WASHINGTON — Stellar pitching kept the Mets afloat in the first half of last season despite their offensive woes. But they cannot produce an encore of their pennant-winning season if their lineup keeps floundering while their pitching is nicked, bruised and stretched thin.
“We were going to ride our pitching,” Manager Terry Collins said before Wednesday’s game. “But we’re not riding it right now. We’ve got as many problems with our pitching as we do anything.”
Wednesday’s 4-2 loss to the Washington Nationals was cruel for the already-limping Mets. Pitching in Steven Matz’s place, the spot starter Logan Verrett allowed two runs over five innings. But even that was too large a deficit for the Mets’ lineup to overcome against Max Scherzer, the Nationals’ starter.
“We’re not even giving ourselves chances,” Collins said, adding later, “We just can’t give our pitchers any room to work.”
The Mets did not score until the ninth inning, when a last-gasp two-run homer by James Loney off Nationals reliever Shawn Kelley snapped a streak of 23 scoreless innings for the team.
The Mets were swept in the three-game series and fell six games behind the Nationals in the National League East. Of late, the Mets have looked worse than their 40-37 record.
“I don’t think we’ve played half our games yet this year,” right fielder Curtis Granderson said. “There’s still a lot of things left that can and hopefully will happen.”
Scherzer toyed with the Mets, who were initially without Granderson after he was scratched from the lineup with lingering calf tightness. Even though Granderson has been inconsistent this season, he had hit well against Scherzer in the past. Alejandro De Aza, who entered the game with a .165 average, started in right field instead because Collins said the team had few options.
After Scherzer gave up a single to Asdrubal Cabrera and walked Loney in the second inning, he retired the next 18 batters, until an eighth-inning single by Brandon Nimmo.
The Mets struggled again with runners on base. After Nimmo and the pinch-hitting Granderson singled in the eighth, pinch-hitter Travis d’Arnaud grounded out, and De Aza struck out.
“If they keep adding pressure on themselves, they’re going to continue to struggle,” Collins said. “That’s one of the things we try to make sure they have to understand: They have to be themselves.”
General Manager Sandy Alderson, Collins and the coaching staff have met about the offense and discussed the odd dynamics: Some players are performing at or better than their career averages, but the lineup as a whole has struggled immensely, especially with runners in scoring position.
“We’re just not driving in any runs,” Collins said. “That’s been the frustrating part. It’s not that we’re striking out. We’re popping up, or a double-play ball.”
The Mets have a power-hitting team, so asking players to bunt or hit and run would go against their strengths.
“When you start to change a team that’s built one way and start to make them do something different, you’re going to get your butt beat,” Collins said.
Earlier in the season, the Mets appeared like an all-or-nothing, home-run-driven team. Although they hit only .211 as a team in May, they smashed 40 home runs. They have a higher average in June, but they have hit only 24 homers, and the inconsistent offense has put a strain on the pitching staff.
In the second inning, Verrett gave up a solo home run to the ex-Met Daniel Murphy. Collins wanted to limit the workloads of Addison Reed and Jeurys Familia, so he turned to reliever Sean Gilmartin in the eighth. Gilmartin gave up a two-run homer to Murphy, who has hit .429 (15 for 35) with four home runs against the Mets this season, his first since leaving the team.
“I felt like I kept us in the game and gave us a chance to come back and win it,” Verrett said. “I wish that I wouldn’t have given up the two runs.”
Verrett was put in this position because of the effects of bone spurs on the Mets’ rotation. The team asked Verrett to start Wednesday and gave Matz an extra day of rest after he received anti-inflammatory medication for the large bone spur in his left elbow. He will try to pitch through it.
Noah Syndergaard has a smaller and less intrusive bone spur in the back of his right elbow.
“As long as I’m staying on my anti-inflammatories and my mechanics are on point, I’m able to go out there every five days and compete,” Syndergaard said.
For the Mets, the immediate road ahead will be even tougher. Matz was expected to pitch Thursday against the Chicago Cubs, one of the best teams in baseball this season.

Mayor Bill de Blasio’s counsel and chief legal adviser, Maya Wiley, is resigning next month from her City Hall position to become the chairwoman of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, New York City’s independent oversight agency for the Police Department.
The move represents the latest shake-up for the de Blasio administration amid continuing state and federal investigations into the mayor’s fund-raising, and fills a two-month vacancy at the police review board created by the resignation of its chairman, Richard D. Emery, in April.
A civil rights lawyer and advocate for racial and social justice, Ms. Wiley joined the de Blasio administration in early 2014 to focus on legal issues as well as on the mayor’s efforts to address issues of inequality. But over time, Ms. Wiley became discouraged over not being part of Mr. de Blasio’s inner circle and felt cut out of both legal questions and advocacy, according to a person familiar with her thinking. On the former, Mr. de Blasio often relied instead on the city’s corporation counsel and Henry Berger, the mayor’s special counsel; on the latter, he favored his top political aides. The person requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.
More recently, Ms. Wiley was assigned to help craft the administration’s legal response to the state and federal inquiries as well as to requests for the public disclosure of documents, notably emails between Mr. de Blasio and trusted advisers outside the administration.
It was in response to a question from reporters about the withholding of those emails with advisers that Ms. Wiley, defending the practice, described the advisers as “agents of the city” — a designation that appeared novel and resulted in days of unfavorable press coverage.
In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio thanked Ms. Wiley for her service and congratulated her on her new role.
The review board investigates allegations of misconduct by officers and makes recommendations for discipline to the Police Department. Its data on the number of complaints, and its investigations of officers, provide an important barometer of police behavior and a politically important one for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who campaigned on improving police-community relations.
Mr. Wiley will also take a position at the New School in Manhattan. Her moves were reported by The Wall Street Journal.
The announcement of Ms. Wiley’s departure from City Hall followed that of a recently hired director of social media, Scott Kleinberg, who resigned on Saturday, just eight weeks after being hired to bring greater personality to the Twitter, Facebook and other online accounts associated with the mayor’s office. His resignation was reported by DNA Info.
In a Facebook post that was later removed, Mr. Kleinberg complained of long hours and micromanagement and described his experience with the administration as working with “political hacks plus a boss who just couldn’t get it,” adding, “It was a bad combination for sure.” Mr. Kleinberg declined to comment.
The departures came less than two months after Karen Hinton, the mayor’s top spokeswoman, announced her resignation from the administration. (She stayed in the position until mid-June.)

In the early morning hours of Labor Day last year, a group of gunmen from the 8-Trey street gang made their way through a crowd of revelers gathered near a Brooklyn public housing project to celebrate J’ouvert, a pre-dawn party that precedes the annual West Indian American Day Parade. The housing project was “enemy territory,” the authorities said, the stronghold of a rival gang, the Folk Nation.
As hundreds of people drank and danced in costume, the warring factions spotted each other, and a gunfight broke out in the darkness. Caught in the crossfire was an up-and-coming lawyer in the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Carey Gabay, who was at the festivities with his brother. Mr. Gabay, 43, who was of Jamaican heritage, died a week later from his wounds.
For some in government and law enforcement circles, the death of Mr. Gabay, who had risen from a childhood in Bronx public housing to Harvard Law School and then to public service, was emblematic of the havoc that street gangs have inflicted on New York City residents.
On Wednesday, as part of a continuing investigation, the authorities announced that three men had been indicted in the killing.
One of the men, Micah Alleyne, 24, was already in custody, having been indicted last month. The other two — Tyshawn Crawford, 21, and Keith Luncheon, 24 — were named along with Mr. Alleyne in a new indictment on Wednesday, which holds all three equally responsible for Mr. Gabay’s murder. Each of the men is charged with second-degree murder.
“These defendants are charged with creating a killing field in a crowd of innocent people, showing depraved indifference to human life and causing the death of Carey Gabay,” Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, said in a statement about the case.
At a news conference at his office, Mr. Thompson said that 20 gang members, armed with as many as 27 guns, had taken part in the gunfight in which dozens of shots were fired. He promised to seek indictments against the others involved in the episode. “This is just the beginning,” he said.
At the time of his death, Mr. Gabay was first deputy counsel for the Empire State Development Corporation and lived with his wife in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn. He was shot in the head while trying to escape the gunfire by ducking between two cars in a parking lot at the Ebbets Field Houses on Bedford Avenue in Crown Heights.
The housing complex had long been Folk Nation turf, Mr. Thompson said, and several of the gang’s members were among the crowd on an outdoor patio there during the J’ouvert celebration. Most of the shots fired that morning came from the direction of the patio, Mr. Thompson added. Members of both the Folk Nation and the 8-Treys had standing orders, he said, to open fire at each other on sight.
“When these two gangs see each other,” Mr. Thompson said, “there is no talking, just shooting.”
Surveillance-camera footage taken that morning, which Mr. Thompson played at the news conference, showed people frantically fleeing the patio and scurrying for cover as shots rang out. Investigators also discovered footage that Mr. Thompson said shows Mr. Alleyne firing a gun into the crowd, then running into a building at the Ebbets Field Houses.
Mr. Alleyne, who was living in a homeless shelter in Jamaica, Queens, when he was arrested in May, was a Folk Nation member, Mr. Thompson said. He added that Mr. Crawford, who lives in East New York, belonged to the Hoodstarz gang, which is allied with the Folk Nation. Mr. Thompson described Mr. Luncheon, who lives in Crown Heights, as a member of the 8-Trey gang, a faction of the Crips.
A fourth defendant, Stanley Elianor, 25, was indicted in October on weapons charges in connection with Mr. Gabay’s murder for carrying a MAC-10 machine pistol during the melee.
Police Commissioner William J. Bratton, appearing with Mr. Thompson at the news conference, said his department was targeting street gangs across the city, adding that officers had arrested gang members in three separate operations in Manhattan on Wednesday morning. Mr. Bratton also said that this year, for the first time, J’ouvert organizers would have to secure a permit for their event, which has traditionally taken place without official city approval. The police, the commissioner said, would increase their presence at the festivities in September to ensure there was no violence.
“If so much as a sneeze is made by these gangs in the run-up to the festival, we will be there,” Mr. Bratton said, “and not to say, ‘gesundheit.’ ”

URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/nyregion/tekserve-precursor-to-the-apple-store-to-close-after-29-years.html

It was the Apple Store in New York City before there was such a thing as an Apple Store.
Before iPods and iPads and iPhones, before Apple started selling and servicing its devices out of a glass cube on Fifth Avenue, the eclectic Tekserve store on West 23rd Street in Manhattan was where customers went for upgrades to their PowerBook laptops or to have their computers fixed.
But times have changed, Tekserve’s managers said, and on Wednesday, they announced that the company was closing its retail and customer-service operation. The service center will remain open until July 31, and the retail store will close on Aug. 15. About 70 employees will lose their jobs, the company said.
“This is a cultural shift,” the company’s chief executive, Jerry Gepner, said in an interview in his office above the store. “It’s not a failure of the business. It’s like this giant wave finally crashed down upon us.”
Tekserve found its niche in an era when Apple had a much smaller slice of the computer market. Among many of Tekserve’s customers then, Apple computers had a devoted following. “It was the cult of Mac,” said Mr. Gepner, who, before running Tekserve, was a regular customer.
He said that customers had gravitated to Tekserve to buy Apple computers, have them serviced or have questions about them answered at a time when computers were more cumbersome to use and help was not simply a Google search away. “It was also a gathering place,” Mr. Gepner said, “where knowledge was shared.”
Tekserve opened in 1987, focusing exclusively on repairs at first, and has always operated out of spaces on 23rd Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. More than 15 years ago, it moved into its current home, with 10,000 square feet of retail and service space, and grew into something of a New York City fixture. On “Sex and the City,” for instance, when Carrie Bradshaw’s laptop crashed, she rushed to Tekserve.
While Apple’s own stores are sleek and modern in appearance, Tekserve had the feel of a throwback, its shelves lined with old-fashioned radios and a soda machine where customers could grab a chilled Coca-Cola in a glass bottle. There was also a “museum” of Apple computers, with models dating back more than three decades, including a Macintosh 128K — the original Apple Macintosh personal computer — signed by Stephen Wozniak, the company’s co-founder.
These days, though, Apple has six stores in Manhattan, including one in Chelsea, not far from Tekserve. There is also a Best Buy store just on the other side of Sixth Avenue from Tekserve. And then there are the options online.
Resellers like Tekserve, once among the few places where customers could get Apple products, have been the victims of the technology company’s growth. But also, Tekserve said in a statement, swiftly rising rent has not helped.
Mr. Gepner said that when he joined Tekserve in 2014, the owners asked him to see whether the diminishing retail operation could be saved. But, he said, the owners realized that a turnaround seemed unlikely. “For us,” he said, “the trend wasn’t going to reverse.”
Talk of the store’s closing had circulated for weeks among neighbors and regular customers. Employees were officially told on Wednesday that the end was imminent.
“We love our customers, and we love what we do,” Mr. Gepner said. “But there comes a point where that doesn’t make sense anymore, as much as we love it.”
The company will continue with its corporate sales and professional services, as well as with an operation focused on small- and medium-size businesses, an area that has experienced growth, Mr. Gepner said.
Outside the store on Wednesday afternoon, word had not yet reached many customers, who said they were disappointed. Alan Wolk said he had been coming to Tekserve for about 15 years, including once to repair a keyboard damaged by spilled coffee.
“It’s been here forever,” he said. “These guys, they know their stuff. You can trust them.”
Kerry Elson said she first came to Tekserve about a decade ago, when she was still working as an intern and trying to figure out how to use a new computer. She kept coming because she trusted those who worked there.
“I feel like this is my go-to,” she said. “It seemed like they were on your side.”

OMAHA — The United States Olympic swimming trials are the spectacle that Michael Phelps built. If he had not strapped the sport to his broad back and climbed to the Olympic summit six times in Athens in 2004 and eight times in eight nights in Beijing in 2008, there would be no pre-finals light show at CenturyLink Center, no ticket scalpers. The crowds would be far smaller than 14,000, and fewer athletes would be extending their careers past college with the help of corporate endorsements.
And there would have been at least one fewer entrant in the 200-meter butterfly.
Phelps’s influence on the sport he set out to make more prominent, more professional, goes well beyond the eyeballs and the excitement he has brought to swimming since he appeared in his first United States trials, a much more subdued affair in Indianapolis in 2000. Phelps has inspired a generation to swim, including a few world-caliber athletes who crafted competitive schedules in Phelps’s image.
Nobody was Phelps’s equal in the 200-meter butterfly final on Wednesday. He qualified for his fifth Olympic team by winning in 1 minute 54.84 seconds, ahead of Tom Shields (1:55.81). Those in his wake included Chase Kalisz, 22, who finished fifth, having already earned a berth to the Rio Games with a victory in the 400-meter individual medley on Sunday.
Kalisz’s best leg in the I.M. is the breaststroke, and he could probably be world-class in that stroke’s events if he put his mind (and his training) to it. But Kalisz grew up in the Baltimore suburbs, and his second home was Meadowbrook Aquatic & Fitness Center, which Phelps had made famous as the most illustrious in a long line of star swimmers produced by North Baltimore Aquatic Club.
Kalisz wanted to be like Mike, so he made himself into a world-class butterfly swimmer. “Me doing butterfly is a testament to me wanting to swim the same event as Michael,” Kalisz said. “Butterfly didn’t come natural to me.”
He added: “Butterfly was something I had to work at, and I just loved racing next to Michael, and I did that enough that ultimately I would say the 200 butterfly is probably my second-best event. So I think me just wanting to emulate Michael so much is why my 2 fly is the way it is.”
The Phelps effect knows no geographical boundaries. At the 2012 Olympics, the South African Chad Le Clos swam the same four individual events as Phelps (the 100 and 200 butterfly and the 200 and 400 I.M.). After handing Phelps his first international defeat in 10 years in the 200 butterfly, Le Clos explained that he had added more events to his program, including the one that gave him a gold medal, after watching Phelps win a record eight golds in Beijing.
“He was the reason I swam the butterfly,” Le Clos said. “It’s not a joke.”
He added: “That’s why I swim the 200 freestyle, both the I.M.s. I don’t swim it for any other reason than just because Michael does.”
Le Clos took it personally when Phelps said last year that the men’s butterfly times around the world had been slow after the London Games, a factor that nudged Phelps out of retirement. After winning the 100 butterfly in 50.56 seconds at last summer’s world championships in Russia — a competition from which Phelps was absent — Le Clos crowed that his idol could “keep quiet now.”
Phelps, who competed at the United States senior nationals last summer after being removed from the American squad for the world championships following a drunken-driving arrest, responded hours later with a 50.45 to win the 100 butterfly.
“Chad liked me, and then he didn’t like me,” Phelps said recently with a laugh. “He said I was his hero, and then he was calling me out.”
In the winter of his career, Phelps finds himself in a position similar to that of Tiger Woods: The children he inspired have grown up to provide some of his fiercest competition.
At the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships in Australia, Daiya Seto of Japan shyly approached Phelps and showed him a photograph, taken at the 2001 edition of the meet in Japan. It was of a 7-year-old Seto, now one of the top individual medley swimmers in the world, posing with Phelps. “It was unbelievable,” Phelps said. “It’s insane.”
The Australian Mitch Larkin had not yet become a worldbeater in the backstroke events when he had a memorable encounter with Phelps. It was in 2012, at an Olympic tuneup meet in the United States. Larkin said he had been walking on the pool deck after racing in the 200 I.M. when Phelps called him by name, praised his effort and said, “Keep doing what you’re doing.”
Larkin said, “That was a massive moment for me.”
He said he had called his parents back in Australia, the time difference be damned, to tell them about the encouragement. “It just brings tears to my eyes remembering how excited Mitch was,” said Larkin’s mother, Judy. “It was a lovely moment for him that he’ll always treasure.”
Four years later, Larkin, 22, is the reigning world champion and the world No. 1 in the 100 and 200 backstrokes. Phelps’s magnanimous gesture, however indirectly, could end up spelling the end to the United States’ dominance in the stroke. The American men have won the last five Olympic gold medals awarded in the backstroke events.
The loss to Le Clos notwithstanding, Phelps has owned the 200 butterfly since placing fifth in the event at the 2000 Olympics at age 15. He has held the world record continuously since 2001, lowering it by 3.41 seconds in that span, to 1:51.51.
Between 2007 and 2009, his peak performance years, Phelps posted the four fastest times in history in the event. His 1:52.94 at last summer’s senior nationals led the world rankings in 2015.
The world has closed the gap, but Phelps remains the gold standard.

OMAHA — In the first three races of her third Olympic trials — two heats of the 100-meter backstroke and the 200-meter freestyle preliminaries — Missy Franklin swam scared. She put together a more composed race in the semifinals of the 200, and then a day later, in Wednesday’s final, Franklin broke free of the chains of anxiety that had constrained her.
Franklin, 21, finished second to Katie Ledecky in a time of 1 minute 56.18 seconds to earn a berth in the individual event and the 4x200 freestyle relay at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. Ledecky was clocked in 1:54.88.
“People say there’s nothing like making your first Olympic team,” Franklin said. “But there’s nothing like making your second Olympic team.”
Allison Schmitt, the reigning Olympic champion in the 200 freestyle, will not defend her title. But the tears she shed after the race were not from disappointment. “I don’t know the last time I had happy tears,” said Schmitt, who finished fourth to secure her passage to Rio as a relay team member.
Franklin and Schmitt embraced after the race. Few people could understand Schmitt’s emotions better than Franklin, who finished seventh in the 100-meter backstroke on Tuesday. She needed to finish in the top two to be able to defend her Olympic title in the event.
“Last night was really hard,” Franklin said, adding that she had struggled to handle the expectations and pressure that she felt to match, or exceed, her 2012 performances. She was thinking about making the Olympic team, she said, and that was the wrong mind-set. “It’s just to swim well,” she said.
And swim well Franklin did, earning the admiration of the 19-year-old Ledecky in the process. “I told her after the race she’s one tough cookie,” Ledecky said. “She got the job done tonight.”
Melanie Margalis also showed her toughness by working an overtime shift. After finishing sixth in the 200 freestyle, which put her on the Olympic relay, she came back less than an hour later and somehow found a closing kick to out-touch Caitlin Leverenz, the bronze medalist in the event in 2012, by five-hundredths of a second with a 2:11.11. Maya DiRado, the winner of the 400 I.M., completed the double by touching first in 2:09.54.
“I can’t believe that just happened,” said Margalis, adding: “That 200 was one of the most painful I’ve had recently, so at first I was kind of like, oh, know, I have another event to do. But it worked out O.K.”

URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/business/dealbook/lionsgate-is-said-to-be-near-deal-to-buy-starz.html

Lionsgate is near a deal to buy Starz, uniting the film studio behind “The Hunger Games” with the premium cable home of the “Outlander” television series, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.
Any takeover would come at a premium to Starz’s Wednesday closing stock price of $28.25, which valued the channel operator at about $2.8 billion. Lionsgate closed on Wednesday with a market value of $3 billion.
A deal could be announced as soon as Thursday, according to the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Many details were being ironed out, and the talks could still falter.
If an agreement is reached, it would be the end of a long road for Starz, which has been the subject of merger speculation for three years, since being spun off from the Liberty Media empire controlled by the billionaire John C. Malone.
It also would be the latest instance of consolidation in the media industry.
Starz, run by the former HBO executive Chris Albrecht, has become one of the country’s top premium TV networks with hits like “Outlander” and “Power.”
The channel has surpassed Showtime to become the second-biggest premium cable TV network in the country with an estimated 23.6 million subscribers, according to SNL Kagan. It is topped only by the longtime king of premium cable, HBO.
Earlier this year, Starz rolled out a stand-alone app for Apple and Google devices, part of a trend of channels looking beyond traditional cable bundles.
For Lionsgate, buying the cable channel would help give it scale as media and telecommunications rapidly consolidate. Starz could help lock in an outlet for Lionsgate’s TV productions, providing ballast for a sometimes volatile movie business.
Analysts have discussed a potential tie-up of Lionsgate and Starz for some time. Last year, Lionsgate disclosed that it had acquired a stake in Starz through a complicated stock swap organized by Mr. Malone. Earlier this year, Lionsgate said that it was exploring a potential takeover of the cable channel.
Starz fielded multiple takeover bids, according to the person briefed on the matter. But Lionsgate has been considered a front-runner for some time, in part because the companies had worked together on projects like the TV shows “Boss” and “Crash.”
And then there is Mr. Malone, who sits on Lionsgate’s board and has long been known as a savvy deal maker.
His counterpart at Lionsgate is Mark Rachesky, the investor who is chairman of the studio and has a reputation for hard-nosed negotiating.
Representatives for Lionsgate and Starz declined to comment or were not available for comment on the talks, which were reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

Under slate-colored light slanting from the skylights, the women entered the city pool on Wednesday morning, its oxidized copper ceiling lending a mint-green cast to the water’s surface. Their swimming outfits would have been considered prudish even by the standards of 1922, when the pool was built. They swam in dresses, some with long sleeves. One paddled in thick black tights. Inside the locker room, wigs sat upside down on window ledges and benches while their owners swam with heads under ruffled swimming caps or knotted silk scarves.
The swimmers were Hasidic women, who abide by strict codes of modesty and who go to the Metropolitan Recreation Center in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for an unusual feature: It is one of two city swimming pools with gender-segregated hours. The other is the St. John’s Recreation Center in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
Although Wednesday was the urbanite’s summer solstice — the day that New York City’s 55 outdoor pools opened for the season and children could, at last, carom into the chlorine — the swimming season at the placid indoor pool in Williamsburg lasts all year. But a tempest has been threatening it, and the women who have long seen the lap pool as a sanctuary are awaiting a decision that city officials now say is imminent about the future of the segregated swimming sessions.
For 20 years, the center has blocked off female-only hours to accommodate the area’s large Hasidic population. The pool has no male-only hours, and some Hasidic men swim during the hours that are open to all genders. An anonymous complaint was lodged recently with the city’s Human Rights Commission, which sent a notice to the parks department this spring saying that the policy might violate a city law barring gender discrimination in public accommodations.
A public furor soon ensued.
For critics, the pool’s segregated hours inappropriately create a religious exemption at a public facility, a violation of the separation of church and state. But defenders of the hours contend it is a fair accommodation for a minority group, akin to wheelchair ramps, that truly makes the pool a municipal space for all — at least at their appointed hour.
The Human Rights Commission and the parks department said the agencies had been in talks and planned to announce their decision as early as this week.
Women’s hours are held three times a week during the summer months. At 10 a.m. on Wednesday, a lifeguard’s whistle squealed. “Everybody out,” she said.
In fact, the message was just for the men. The women’s hours would begin at 10:30 a.m. (There was a half-hour break in between.) Swimming freestyle in the lane marked “Slow,” Tim Main stopped and gripped the pool ladder, peeling off his goggles. He turned to the nearest pool-goer and threw up his hands. “I hope this goes all the way to the Supreme Court,” he said before climbing out and shaking off.
“The idea of being kicked out from swimming time isn’t really the issue,” Mr. Main, 56, said later, now dry and standing on Bedford Avenue in front of the brick pool house. “It’s the creeping of religious stricture into public space.”
Behind him, inside the recreation complex, a lifeguard pulled closed the thick plastic curtains to obscure the swimmers from the lobby during the women’s hours.
“Here in New York, where we have people from so many different backgrounds, the idea of being culturally sensitive is something that everybody talks about,” said State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Democrat who represents the heavily Hasidic area of Borough Park and has opposed ending the sessions. “You might think, ‘Wow, why should the city have to bend over to do this?’ But there is a lot of argument that this is all part of reasonable accommodation.”
But Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, took the opposite view.
“People who have a religious objection to men and women, boys and girls, swimming in the same pool at the same time have every right to their beliefs and to limit their swimming in accordance with those religious beliefs,” she said. “But they have no right to impose a regime of gender discrimination on a public pool.
“What we have here is the imposition of a religious dogma to the detriment to the rest of the city,” she added.
Gripping a yellow pool noodle, Miriam Kahn, 77, treaded water in a pink dress and a pink ruffled swimming cap on Wednesday morning. “In our religion, women don’t go to no beach, don’t go to no movies, nothing,” she said in a thick Israeli accent. “Can’t we have this something?”
Other cities have accommodated religious preferences for single-sex swimming. In Toronto, a similar program at a public pool that catered to Muslim women drew praise for offering that population a rare chance to learn to swim. There are similar programs elsewhere in the United States.
Only 45 swimmers at a time are permitted at the pool in Williamsburg. Most days, Ms. Kahn said, there is a line of women waiting their turn, including the occasional Muslim woman. On Wednesday, the lanes were full of women in calf-length, denim-colored dresses with three-quarter sleeves. The only thing that vaguely identified the outfits as seaworthy was a palm tree or a beach ball embroidered on the chest.
In a black frock, Tzurtie Kahan, 66, swam up. Hasidic men, she explained, go to synagogue, to Torah study, to work. Women like her have few opportunities to socialize, she said. “This is a freedom country,” she said in English inflected with a Yiddish patois. “Can’t we practice our religion? Can’t there be space for us?”
She, too, had a complaint about the women’s hours at the pool: They are too brief.

WINTER GARDEN, Fla. — Jeff Hornacek, the new Knicks coach, delivered some truth Wednesday afternoon after his team’s first summer league practice.
“We have a lot of roster spots right now,” he said.
The Knicks are set for a summer of change, with just five players under contract for next season. That means opportunities for the youngsters who have assembled here for summer league. Ognjen Kuzmic? Ron Baker? DaJuan Summers? Some of these players may turn out to be more than mere footnotes moving forward, if only because the Knicks need bodies.
Then again, the Knicks hope to make their biggest splash in free agency, an annual mad dash for dollars that will commence Friday, when players can begin meeting with interested teams. The Knicks are expected to have more than $30 million to spend under the salary cap, but that does not make them unique.
“A lot of teams have money to spend,” Hornacek said. “We have a pretty good amount, it sounds like. Hopefully, we can get a player or two that will help us.”
Having traded Robin Lopez to the Chicago Bulls last week as a part of a deal that sent Derrick Rose to New York, the Knicks will make a priority of landing a defense-minded center, Hornacek said. The team also needs a starting shooting guard, but that seems to be second on the list.
“I definitely think we need an experienced big in there,” Hornacek said. “With the two guard, we probably should be able to find someone. We have enough scorers. We need a guy at the two spot who can help run the offense, maybe get some kick-out 3s. But maybe the five man might be a little more important of a position.”
Hornacek did not name possibilities, but the Knicks could target Pau Gasol or Joakim Noah, both of whom played alongside Rose with the Bulls. As for the biggest name in free agency, it remains to be seen if the Knicks will be included in the Kevin Durant sweepstakes.
Phil Jackson, the Knicks’ president, was here Wednesday to watch practice from the bleachers. Afterward, he made his way down to the court to speak with Hornacek and the coaching staff, appearing animated as he mimicked a cut to the basket. Hornacek was asked about Jackson’s operating as a hands-on executive.
“I think that’s great,” Hornacek said. “How many G.M.s have that many championships and ran the offense? I don’t think it’s weird at all. It’s basketball. All coaches want to have different thoughts. Nobody can expect to know everything. With Phil’s expertise in seeing this run for years and years, any little hints he can give us have been helpful.”
The Knicks are doing things differently this summer. A longtime mainstay at the Las Vegas summer league, which is typically staged later in July, well after the start of free agency, the Knicks are participating in the Orlando summer league for the first time instead. Their first game is scheduled for Saturday against the Detroit Pistons.
Kristaps Porzingis, the Knicks’ presumed cornerstone, will not participate. He has been working out at home in Latvia.
Cleanthony Early, a second-round draft pick in 2014 who missed most of last season after he was shot in the knee during a late-night robbery, said he was looking forward to his stint with the team in Orlando. While Hornacek has made it clear that he plans to use parts of the triangle offense, a scheme favored by Jackson, Early said the team was looking to push the ball more.
“We’re not looking so much to force it into the triangle,” said Early, a small forward. “Being athletic and fast, we want to get the easiest and quickest baskets we can.”
While no official announcements have been made, Hornacek has filled out his staff. On Wednesday, he was joined by a mix of holdovers (Kurt Rambis, Joshua Longstaff and David Bliss) and newcomers (Howard Eisley, Jerry Sichting and Corey Gaines). Sichting and Gaines were on Hornacek’s staff when he coached the Phoenix Suns.
“You’ve got to develop some continuity,” Hornacek said.
Along those lines, Hornacek recently visited Carmelo Anthony at one of his private workouts in New York. Hornacek wanted to talk with Anthony about last season, he said, to get a sense of what had worked and what changes Anthony hoped to see.
Hornacek also said he had studied game film before visiting Anthony so he could share some insights about his positioning on the court.
“Simple stuff,” Hornacek said. “Nothing new. But I just told him, just from watching tape, a couple of things that I thought could help him. The guy knows how to play. He’s a great player. There’s not a lot of things. But I think veteran players — they’re trying to learn from year to year, pick one or two things up.”

As Washington Heights rejoiced on Wednesday over the apparent victory of Adriano D. Espaillat in the Democratic primary to choose a successor to Representative Charles B. Rangel, the scene and tone could not have been more different a few dozen blocks to the south.
There, in Harlem, black political leaders and residents began to grapple with the end of a run of more than seven decades during which the neighborhood was represented in Congress by one of its own. The primary results also draw the curtain on an era — already a long time in passing — in which Harlem was the center of black political power in New York City and beyond.
“It’s the end of a culture,” said Rudy Williams, 63, a substance abuse counselor, who was sitting with friends in folding chairs on a sidewalk on Malcolm X Boulevard. Wearing a bright yellow newsboy hat and matching pants, he worried about what Mr. Espaillat’s win would mean for the neighborhood. “Harlem is a far cry from Washington Heights,” he said.
Reginald Jones, 51, chimed in: “We have no more face. It’s a perpetual loss of ground, a loss of the black community having identity.”
Mr. Espaillat, a state senator, was seeking to become the first Dominican immigrant to win election to Congress. He held a lead of 1,236 votes over the closest competitor, State Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright, an African-American like Mr. Rangel, who endorsed him.
Mr. Wright refused to concede, suggesting on Tuesday night that there had been voting irregularities and insisting that all absentee ballots and affidavit ballots be counted. But Mr. Espaillat’s lead, equal to nearly three percentage points, appeared insurmountable.
If that lead does hold up, Mr. Espaillat is almost assured victory in the general election in November, since the district, covering Upper Manhattan and parts of the Bronx, is overwhelmingly Democratic.
Just as assuredly, Mr. Espaillat’s ascension led political insiders to debate what it meant for the shifting terrain of New York City politics.
“This is an amazing transition for two communities,” said George Arzt, a political consultant. “It’s historic for the Dominican community to have its first congressperson. It is a blow to the African-American community to lose a congressman who has long represented the dreams of African-Americans in Harlem.”
Mr. Rangel has served in Congress for 45 years. Before him there was Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a giant of 20th-century black politics.
Mr. Rangel was part of what was known as the Gang of Four, a group of Harlem politicians whose influence dominated the city and state and reached to Washington. Two of the group’s members, Percy E. Sutton and Basil A. Paterson, have died; another, former Mayor David N. Dinkins, is retired; and Mr. Rangel, 86, is about to follow him.
While Harlem’s grip on political power may have faded, the influence of other parts of the city has increased, in particular Brooklyn and Southeast Queens, where there are three black members of Congress, and prominent black local officials, including Letitia James, the city’s public advocate, and the Brooklyn borough president, Eric L. Adams.
“The passage out of office of Rangel and the failure of his protégé to win the nomination is the exclamation point in a sentence that we’ve been reading for a while,” said John Mollenkopf, who directs the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York Graduate Center.
Much of what has happened is a response to the city’s changing demographics. Upper Manhattan has lost black and Puerto Rican residents — partly because of rising rents caused by gentrification — while gaining white and Dominican residents.
And the boundaries of Mr. Rangel’s district were redrawn several years ago to include parts of the Bronx, which meant the district over all had more Hispanic than black residents.
So for many, Mr. Espaillat’s victory, or that of another Hispanic, was just a matter of time.
That suggests a broader trend of increased Hispanic political power in the city, although there are many challenges for Hispanic politicians to mobilize a fractured electorate. Hispanics tend to identify by nationality first, so Colombian, Dominican, Ecuadorean, Mexican and Puerto Rican voters may support politicians from their own national groups, but may not necessarily see shared interests with those from other groups.
That could mean that while Mr. Espaillat’s apparent victory justifiably sparked proud celebration in Washington Heights, a Dominican enclave, it may not say much about Hispanic influence beyond Upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
Melissa Mark-Viverito, the City Council speaker, who is Puerto Rican, supported Mr. Espaillat. The Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., supported Mr. Wright, but Mr. Espaillat still performed much better in the Bronx.
Others cautioned not to read too much into Mr. Espaillat’s victory.
“There’s no seismic shift,”’ said Geoffrey L. Garfield, a political consultant who worked with another candidate in the crowded primary, Adam Clayton Powell IV, who finished far back in the nine-person field. Of the nine candidates in the primary, four were black; together they received more than 50 percent of the vote. That suggests Mr. Espaillat could face a strong challenge in future primaries from a single African-American opponent.
“The next cycle he’ll be challenged again,” Mr. Garfield said. “I think he’ll lose in a one-on-one.”
That sentiment was not widely shared in Washington Heights. Rosanna Crisostomo, Dominican resident of the neighborhood who works in a home care agency, praised Mr. Espaillat’s support for the area as she bought fruit from a stand on the corner of 182nd Street and St. Nicholas Avenue.
“He went for it and he got it,” she said. “Now we hope that every step he takes he thinks about his people.”
Mr. Espaillat, for his part, was clearly sensitive to accusations that he had played too heavily to his Dominican base, and would not represent Harlem with the same vigor as Mr. Rangel.
“To those who voted for one of my worthy opponents: I pledge to work my heart out to represent you, knowing that our district is not a Latino or black or Asian district,” Mr. Espaillat said in a statement on Wednesday. “It’s a district that belongs to all of us, and we simply cannot succeed unless all of us are moving forward together.”

SURT, Libya — Perched on a doorstep, the teenage Juma brothers whiled away the afternoon with a lazy game of checkers, pushing pebbles around a board chalked in the dust, seemingly oblivious to the crackle of gunfire and boom of artillery a few miles away.
They had fled their home in Surt, the Islamic State’s Libyan stronghold, three weeks earlier as a Libyan fighting force, quietly supported by American and British Special Operations troops, swept toward the coastal city from the desert. Now, as the siege intensified, the Juma brothers were sitting out the battle at this farmhouse on the southern edge of Surt, their apprehension tempered by a wave of sheer relief.
“Life was hell,” said Hammad, a lanky 16-year-old with a shock of unkempt hair, describing the Islamic State’s brutal 18-month rule. Cafes were closed, schools renamed and girls flogged for not covering their faces, he said. He watched in horror as a hooded figure chopped off the hand of a thief — a desperate man who had stolen medicine. Nightmares came after the Islamists crucified people accused of crimes at a major traffic junction, then left their bodies to rot.
“I would wake in a panic, thinking I was suffocating,” he said. His brother Mohammed, 19, nodded in agreement. The Islamists had executed his friend Abdullah by pushing him from a tall building, accusing him of blasphemy. Abdullah was 15 years old, Mohammed said.
The assault on Surt, now in its third week, has put the Islamic State in Libya under crushing pressure, threatening to rob the group of its largest base outside Iraq and Syria. The attack force, led by militias from the nearby city of Misurata and organized under the auspices of the United Nations-backed unity government, has corralled the Islamists into the city center, where they are pummeled with bombs and gunfire and cut off from their main escape route by sea.
The siege coincides with the Islamic State’s recent eviction from the Iraqi city of Falluja, and combined they are a heavy blow to the group’s territorial ambitions — even as it retaliates with devastating attacks against civilians. Turkish officials say they suspect the Islamic State of being responsible for the suicide bombings at the Istanbul airport on Tuesday that killed at least 41 people.
The Surt offensive moved with breathtaking speed at first, shrinking the territory controlled by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from 150 miles of coastline to barely four miles. But since the battle reached the densely defended streets of Surt, progress has been measured in yards, and the price in blood has risen sharply.
I arrived last week, with a photographer and a Libyan journalist who has worked for The New York Times since 2011. The first hurdle was bureaucratic: negotiating the maze of official permissions required to work in a country with three rival governments, and split by byzantine rivalries.
After acquiring the paperwork, and a commander willing to take us into the battle zone, we set off at night, speeding down a highway strewn with the charred remains of vehicles destroyed in suicide bombings.
Surt crackled with tension. We had arrived after the bloodiest day of fighting yet, in which 36 Libyan fighters had died and over 150 were injured in the latest push toward Islamic State lines. In all, over 800 men had been wounded since the fighting started, medics at the nearby field hospital said.
On the beach road, where artillery cases littered the empty street, fighters crouched under a berm of sand. Occasionally they leapt to their feet, spraying bullets toward Islamic State fighters in buildings more than 200 yards down the street.
The reply came in the form of a sharp crack, then the soft zip of a sniper’s bullet whistling overhead.
Their commander was Mohammed Ahmed, a preternaturally calm man who, in T-shirt and flip-flops, seemed dressed more for the beach than a front line. He called orders into a walkie-talkie then pointed behind us, to a cluster of holiday villas where Libya’s longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, once housed visiting foreign dignitaries. Now it was raked with bullet holes and smeared with graffiti.
Capturing the villas, and a few hundred yards of road, cost the lives of four men, he said.
Circling drones overhead signaled the presence of small teams of American and British Special Operations forces that, according to Libyan officials, are using surveillance technology to provide targeting information to Libyan artillery spotters and their handful of aging warplanes.
“They tell the ground forces where to push and where to hold, and they coordinate the airstrikes,” said Mohamed Benrasali, a senior politician from Misurata.
That, so far, has been the extent of direct Western help on the battlefield, even as Libyan commanders appeal for more muscular assistance — ammunition, airstrikes and medical supplies.
“Here we are, fighting the West’s war against terrorism,” said Ibrahim Mustafa, 29, a commander, in a widely held view. “But although the West promises help, it never comes.”
The American officials and their allies counter that they must proceed cautiously, worried that such help could upset the precarious balance between Libya’s many factions and potentially inflaming a knotty civil conflict involving an array of outside countries.
Below the drones. the ground fight is a decidedly analogue affair. Many of the Libyan militiamen are part-time fighters armed with decades-old weapons. Their commanders scoff at Pentagon estimates of 6,500 Islamic State fighters in Libya — or a figure of 8,000, given by John Brennan, the director of the C.I.A., in testimony to Congress on June 20. The Libyans estimate that no more than 600 fighters are left in the city. But few doubt that the Islamic State fighters cornered in central Surt — mostly from Tunisia, Egypt and Sudan, according to anecdotal accounts, as well as a smaller number of Libyans — make a determined enemy.
At the beach front, a handful of fighters walked toward the sea, only to halt in their tracks: A barely visible line was pulled tautly across the sand, a mark of land mines laid in the night. The fighters retraced their steps, slowly, to the road.
Despite the fighting, the Islamic State radio station still broadcasts across Surt, offering a mixture of stuffy religious sermons and red-blooded threats against the group’s enemies. But predictions that Surt could become Raqqa on the Mediterranean, in a reference to the Islamic State headquarters in Syria, now look highly unlikely.
As the Libyan fighters push deeper into Surt, the infrastructure of fear that helped the Islamic State exert a viselike grip is being dismantled. At the Zafran roundabout, the scaffolding where men in orange jumpsuits were once executed has been pulled down, and the Islamic State flag has been replaced by the Libyan national standard.
Retreating fighters have mustered at the Ouagadougou Center, a cavernous, marble-walled conference hall turned religious pulpit and weapons store. Their families cluster in an area called Dollar, with no water or electricity, former residents say.
For decades Surt was a byword for tribal cronyism in Libya. Colonel Qaddafi, who was born in a tent 10 miles south of the town, devised a series of vainglorious schemes intended to catapult the obscure city to global prominence. At one point he promoted it as the headquarters of a notional “United States of Africa.”
Today those ideas have gone from ridiculous to tragic as the follies of the era — the luxury hotels and villas, the conference hall and the Great Man-Made River, a multibillion-dollar water project that Colonel Qaddafi hailed as the “eighth wonder of the world” — form a crumbling backdrop to Libya’s latest violent drama.
Colonel Qaddafi’s more enduring legacy is the paranoid factionalism that has pitted Libya’s politicians, fighters and towns, so viciously against one another since 2011, and that could yet endanger battlefield gains against the Islamic State.
A few miles behind the front lines, the commander leading the assault on Surt sat in a cramped room, before a radio transmitter and a large screen with a Google Earth map detailing the battlefield. It was the holy month of Ramadan, so most of his fighters were not eating during daylight hours. In the darkness of evening, after the fast had been broken, the commander lounged in the courtyard of his small compound, sucking on a water pipe, as he welcomed subordinates who huddled over maps, sipped sweet coffee and plotted the next day’s actions.
The commander agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity, citing fears that his family could be targeted in Islamic State attacks. He was at once welcoming and guarded — loudly echoing popular complaints about lack of Western support, but also making it clear that he considered Western intentions in Libya to be cynical.
“We’re sending our youth to die against terrorists, and Europe is playing football matches,” he said, referring to the soccer championship underway.
Surprisingly, he did not see the Islamic State as the greatest danger to Libya. Instead he expounded at length about the perfidy of Khalifa Hifter — the dominant military commander in eastern Libya, and a man widely viewed by many Misuratans as an enemy. The commander suggested that Mr. Hifter, in concert with a relative of Colonel Qaddafi’s based in Cairo, was secretly supporting the Islamic State — a theory given little credence by Western officials, but one that points to the deep suspicions that undergird every aspect of the Libyan society.
Mr. Hifter, for his part, also holds himself out as a warrior against Islamist extremists in the eastern cities of Benghazi and Derna. Last week he traveled to Moscow, requesting that the Kremlin provide him with weapons, Russian news media reported.
Such jostling has plagued efforts to bring Libya to peace since 2011, and helped the Islamic State move into Surt in 2014. Local clashes in recent weeks between rival groups near Tripoli and in Ajdabia, east of Surt, provide ominous signals of rising political as well as military tensions.
Although the unity government enjoys strong backing from the United Nations, the United States and many European countries, it has weak political authority and, on the ground in Surt, little respect. Instead, most fighters claimed to be fighting in the name of their town, their brigade, or their blood.
On the eastern front line, near the city port, Mohammed Haima peered down a pair of old military binoculars, one lens broken, toward the Islamic State lines a few hundred yards away.
The extremists had captured his brother, a fighter named Faisal, last summer, he said. He later learned, from a former prisoner, that Faisal had been tortured and had his fingernails pulled out.
Two months ago Islamists phoned Mr. Haima, offering to trade his brother for another prisoner. No deal was made. So now, Mr. Haima said, he was fighting to find his brother, or to avenge his death.
“Those terrorists are a cancer that needs to be wiped out,” he said. “They made my brother call me to prove he was alive. I’m going to find him for his sake — and for that of our mother.”

FARMINGTON, Conn. — As a pastor, Sam Saylor knows how draining the fight against gun violence can be. For years he attended vigils and comforted families until he could not take it anymore; he could not find the words for the grieving parents.
Then Mr. Saylor’s son Shane was killed, shot in the back as he tried to run from his assailant. Less than two months later, the shootings at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 26 people, including 20 children, put the grimmest possible national spotlight on gun violence.
But minutes after speaking alongside Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and two members of the House of Representatives on Wednesday morning, Mr. Saylor could not conceal his impatience with Congress.
“Truthful?” he said. “We said, did it take Orlando for them to grow courage?”
House Democrats hosted 40 events across the country on Wednesday, with more than 60 members participating, trying to maintain the momentum created by their more than 25-hour sit-in on the chamber floor last week after the June 12 shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Fla.
Scattered across their districts, the handful of committed but often wary activists who greeted them Wednesday served as a reminder of how difficult it can be to keep people energized when they have been disappointed for so long.
Just an hour’s drive from the site of the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Saylor and a few dozen others who favor gun restrictions joined Representatives Elizabeth Esty and Rosa DeLauro, Democrats of Connecticut, at a news conference at the University of Connecticut’s Health Center.
This state has become an emotional center of the gun control debate — and an example to those sick of waiting for Congress to act. In 2013, after Congress failed to restrict access to firearms, Connecticut enacted its own ban on many semiautomatic rifles.
It is a matter of identity for Mary Ellen Thibodeau of West Hartford. As she waited for Ms. Esty and Ms. DeLauro’s event to begin, Ms. Thibodeau, 66, described a trip to Costa Rica after the shooting in Newtown, where she was asked where she was from.
“We said, oh, Connecticut,” she said. “And they said, oh, Newtown. It was like, oh, that’s what we’re known for now. And that was really disappointing.”
Ms. DeLauro dismissed the idea that they were fighting a losing battle because of the nearly unanimous opposition from Republicans, who hold majorities in Congress.
“A vote ultimately may be unlikely, but I’m not going to concede that that is the point,” she said. “The fact of the matter is that we do have an opportunity.”
Democrats are hopeful that the confluence of terrorism and guns in the recent Orlando shooting has been enough to draw a few more Republicans to their side. Last week eight Senate Republicans joined Democrats in keeping alive a “no fly, no buy” bill introduced by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.
Ms. Esty, who represents Newtown, argued that holding a vote would be to their advantage.
“If we were allowed a vote in the House of Representatives on comprehensive background checks, that would pass,” she said. “We have nearly 190 listed co-sponsors, bipartisan, and from conversations in back rooms, there are many Republicans who would vote for it if we were allowed a vote.”
House Democrats saw similar crowds at their events across the country after organizers of the sit-in called last week for a “national day of action” to be held on Wednesday. In Baltimore, several dozen people turned out for an event with four Democratic members of Maryland’s delegation, including Representatives Elijah Cummings and Chris Van Hollen, according to Mr. Van Hollen’s office. At a larger event in Chicago, several hundred people showed up for a rally with six House Democrats, Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois’ office said.
Not every event was so public, though. Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia met with activists at his Lithonia, Ga., office on Wednesday. Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona held a conference call with reporters and local Arizona activists.
Mr. Van Hollen said Democrats are keeping all of their options open about what they will do when they return from the July Fourth recess next week.
“We have lots of options for making sure we do not return to business as usual until we have a vote on these common sense gun safety measures,” he said in a phone interview.
The protest in many ways started two weeks ago, when Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, took to the floor in a 15-hour “talk-athon” with Senator Richard Blumenthal, his fellow Connecticut Democrat, among others.
And House Democrats reminded Republicans of their continued commitment to disruption on Tuesday, when a small group of lawmakers took to the floor during a “pro forma” session and, a largely symbolic protest.
Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, cautioned Monday that he would not allow the disruptions to continue.
“We will not tolerate this,” he said in an interview with the website wispolitics.com.
Despite the wariness of many supporters, the latest push feels like a breakthrough to others. Brandon McGee, a state representative in Connecticut, stood before several dozen people at a forum in Hartford hosted by Representative John Larson, one of the organizers of the sit-in, gesturing enthusiastically as he described what last week’s protest meant to him.
“That was monumental,” Mr. McGee said. “I think it started the new civil rights movement.”
But it also became clear that, in many ways, there is still a gulf among those who support more gun restrictions. Rev. Henry Brown, who was at both events in Connecticut on Wednesday, said he was dismayed that the organizers at the morning news conference in Farmington focused on mass shootings without discussing the violence their neighbors in Hartford grapple with daily.
“They didn’t even mention the violence that goes on in Hartford,” he said.
“If we are on the battlefield together, don’t you think there should have been some mention of what was going on in urban communities?” he continued. “It’s good that we’re talking about long guns, but the majority of our children are being killed by handguns.”
“Our babies die every day,” said Steve Harris, a retired firefighter and former member of the Hartford City Council, who was moderating the forum. “We have our Sandy Hook moment every day.”

A political operative with ties to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is expected to be charged on Thursday in connection with a bribery scheme that involved a State Supreme Court justice in Buffalo, who has already pleaded guilty in the case.
The operative, G. Steven Pigeon, is accused in a criminal complaint of bribing the justice, John A. Michalek, with help for a promotion; favors for two close relatives; Buffalo Sabres hockey tickets; and a seat at one of Mr. Cuomo’s fund-raisers. In return, the complaint says, Mr. Pigeon received favorable treatment in court cases in which he and his acquaintances had an interest.
Mr. Michalek, who had served as a justice since 1995, pleaded guilty in State Supreme Court on Wednesday to a felony count of receiving a bribe. He also admitted to filing a public document with false information, also a felony.
The case stemmed from a joint state and federal investigation led by the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, into Mr. Pigeon’s fund-raising activities.
As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Michalek, who resigned from the bench, has agreed to cooperate with the investigation. Mr. Pigeon is expected to appear in court on Thursday on unspecified charges, according to Matt Mittenthal, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman.
According to the complaint, Mr. Michalek repeatedly asked for Mr. Pigeon’s assistance in moving up to the Appellate Division of the court, where there was a vacancy for an associate judgeship.
“Normally I wouldn’t mention it to you,” the justice wrote in an email to Mr. Pigeon in December 2012, beginning what the complaint said was a quest for the appointment that lasted two and a half years. “Wonder if you could help.”
Mr. Pigeon apparently went straight to the top.
“Unc Steve... How’d you do with the Gov????” Mr. Michalek wrote to Mr. Pigeon on Jan. 8, 2013.
“Bunch happening... In Albany now... Gov went well... Talked u up,” Mr. Pigeon replied. “Let’s have coffee soon.”
Public schedules for Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, on and around that date, when he was preparing for his annual State of the State address, do not show Mr. Pigeon’s name. But the schedules do not always cover every detail of the governor’s day.
If the meeting did occur, nothing seemed to come of it. “Haven’t heard a peep about the Appp Div,” Mr. Michalek wrote to Mr. Pigeon the next month.
John Kelly, a spokesman for the governor, said: “Appointees for any state appellate court must first be reviewed and approved by the judicial screening committee. Mr. Michalek’s name was never advanced by the committee to the governor for consideration for any appointment.”
Mr. Pigeon and various political action committees with which he was involved were the subject of multiple inquiries into possible campaign finance improprieties in 2008. The next year, he and his sometime boss, the Rochester billionaire Tom Golisano, brokered a Republican coup in the State Senate that threw the Capitol into disarray for a month.
Yet Mr. Pigeon, a former chairman of the Erie County Democratic organization, later re-emerged as a key contact in Western New York for Mr. Cuomo’s office as he worked to gather local support during the governor’s 2014 re-election campaign.
Mr. Pigeon’s lawyer, Paul Cambria, declined to comment on Wednesday.
If Mr. Michalek never managed to rise to the Appellate Division, his relatives prospered under Mr. Pigeon’s guidance, according to the complaint. Mr. Pigeon found a contact to help one of those relatives get a job on a political campaign. Mr. Michalek and Mr. Pigeon also repeatedly discussed different options for a second relative, including appointments to a government task force or an education committee.
Through Mr. Pigeon, the relative also got a $1,000 seat at a fund-raiser in November 2013 for Mr. Cuomo’s re-election campaign.
“We will continue to root out public corruption wherever we find it,” Mr. Schneiderman said.
The arrangement had benefits for Mr. Pigeon, too. The emails about job prospects were often interspersed with discussions about several lawsuits that companies he was consulting for had pending before the justice, who was handling commercial civil cases in Erie County Supreme Court.
Mr. Pigeon was receiving money from a party to one of the lawsuits, while his colleagues or acquaintances had a financial stake in others.
Mr. Michalek often emailed updates on the lawsuits to Mr. Pigeon, who replied with his own input; gave Mr. Pigeon advice about the direction of the cases; and handed down rulings that benefited Mr. Pigeon, his clients and his business associates, according to the complaint. In one instance, Mr. Pigeon argued that the justice should deny a motion for a protective order against a subpoena. He complied.
In May 2012, when Mr. Michalek was looking for a lawyer to handle a receivership, he took Mr. Pigeon’s recommendation of a local lawyer whom Mr. Pigeon referred to as “my guy.”
The lawyer did not appear on the court’s list of qualified receivers, but Mr. Michalek cleared that hurdle by signing a special form that said he had “required the expertise” of Mr. Pigeon’s pick.
“Have to give them a spec reason etc,” Mr. Michalek wrote to Mr. Pigeon. “Will figure it out.”

PARIS — Fathi Bayoudh was a respected officer and doctor in the Tunisian military, but on Tuesday night at Istanbul’s main airport he was a father worried about his wayward son.
Dr. Bayoudh, 58, had arrived in Istanbul weeks earlier to find his son, Anouar, 26, who had run off to join the Islamic State group in Syria. When he got word through the Tunisian Embassy in Turkey that the Turkish authorities had detained Anouar in a town near the border with Syria, he called his wife in Tunisia. They arranged to meet at Ataturk airport before heading to the town where Anouar was being held.
The two doctors were hoping to take their only son home.
But shortly before 10 p.m. on Tuesday, as he waited at the airport for his wife to arrive, three suicide attackers opened fire and then blew themselves up, killing at least 41 people, including Dr. Bayoudh. His death was confirmed Wednesday by Tunisia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His wife was not hurt in the attack.
Dr. Bayoudh “was a very generous man, lively and always very active,” said Leyla Njim, 32, a close friend of the family.
During his mandatory military service, he rose to the rank of colonel-major and then took charge of the pediatrics department at the military hospital in Tunis, the capital. He also worked for several nongovernmental organizations that provided aid in war-torn countries.
When their son left home earlier this year for what he said was an internship in Switzerland, they had no idea that he planned to join the Islamic State. When they learned the truth, they were devastated, family and friends reached by phone said.
According to a family member who asked not to be named because of concerns about his job, Anouar never went to Switzerland but traveled to France and then Turkey. From there he went to Iraq, where he joined the Islamic State group, and then to Syria.
The trip took about three months, but when he arrived in Syria, things were not as he expected. He called his father a month later, telling him he wanted to return home and asking him for help. Anouar then turned himself over to the Turkish authorities at the border.
Tunisia’s recent history has been particularly turbulent since the 2011 ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, followed by an economic crisis and the country’s embrace of democracy.
It has also been the target of several terrorist attacks in the past two years carried out by fighters from the Islamic State and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb.
Many of the North African country’s young people are adrift, jobless and embittered by unfulfilled promises. As many as 3,000 Tunisians have joined Islamist groups to fight in Syria in recent years, the Soufan Group, a New York-based organization that conducts security analysis, said in a report released in 2014.
Anouar, Dr. Bayoudh’s son, had trouble settling on a career. He studied medicine in Mauritania, then he studied to be a pilot at a school in Tunis. He was studying for a business degree when he left for Syria.
Dr. Bayoudh was known as a “rather severe man” but also “very kind” by the medical interns who worked closely with him, combining a concern for others with the rigor of a soldier, said Yossra Sdiri, 30, a medical student.
“He had a fatherly side, and he would say, ‘I am the only one who criticizes you,’ but then would defend us to other professors,” Ms. Sdiri recalled.
Mrs. Njim, the family friend, said Dr. Bayoudh was shocked by his son’s turn to radicalism but hopeful that he could be reunited with his family. “He loved his son so much,” she said, “he would have done anything for him. He went there to bring him back.”

SAN FRANCISCO — With more start-ups and venture firms working harder to raise capital, there has been talk of a Silicon Valley slowdown. But investors in several venture funds are bucking that notion.
On Wednesday, the venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had raised a total of $1.4 billion across two investment funds over the last couple of months.
Kleiner Perkins joins a list of venture firms that have recently raised more than a billion dollars.
In the first quarter of this year, Founders Fund raised $1.3 billion, while Accel and Norwest Venture Partners each raised $1.2 billion, according to National Venture Capital Association data. Over all, the American venture industry raised $12 billion in the first quarter, a 59 percent increase by dollar commitments from the previous year, but a 17 percent decrease in total number of funds, the data shows.
A spokeswoman for Kleiner Perkins said the firm was in a quiet period and could not discuss the filings.
Kleiner Perkins has raised $1 billion for its KPCB Digital Growth Fund III, according to the filings. Growth funds tend to be large because they are used to fund older, late-stage private companies that need more money to grow.
Late-stage investments have grabbed headlines over the last few years for producing more than 160 private companies valued at more than $1 billion, including Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox and Snapchat.
Kleiner Perkins raised its first late-stage investment fund in 2010, and this is the firm’s third such vehicle.
Partners Mary Meeker, Ted Schlein, Mood Rowghani and Noah Knauf will lead the growth fund. This year, Mr. Knauf joined Kleiner Perkins from Warburg Pincus, where he was known for his investments in health care-related companies.
Kleiner Perkins also raised $400 million for its seventh venture fund, which makes smaller, earlier-stage investments.
That fund will be led by partners Ted Schlein, Beth Seidenberg, Mike Abbott, Wen Hsieh and Eric Feng. Mr. Feng recently joined the firm from Flipboard. He also worked at Kleiner Perkins six years before in an investing role.
John Doerr, the firm’s longtime leader, said in March that he was stepping back from day-to-day management.

Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide and confidante, acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state created frustration at times because of computer glitches but said she did not raise concerns about the unusual arrangement, according to a transcript of a deposition made public on Wednesday.
Ms. Abedin, who served as Mrs. Clinton’s deputy chief of staff at the State Department and is now the vice chairwoman of her presidential campaign, said her boss’s use of the private server was never intended to sidestep federal record-keeping laws. Mrs. Clinton, she said, wanted to protect her personal information “just like anybody who has personal email would want to keep their personal email private.”
The exchange focused on a 2010 email first disclosed by the State Department’s inspector general in a scathing report last month, in which Mrs. Clinton raised concerns about accepting a new BlackBerry because she did not want “any risk of the personal being accessible.” Mrs. Clinton has previously said that using a single, private email address on a private server was simply a matter of convenience.
Ms. Abedin is the seventh of eight aides and department officials who have now given sworn testimony in a legal proceeding brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative government watchdog organization. The organization’s case began with an inquiry into Ms. Abedin’s special employment status at the end of Mrs. Clinton’s tenure at the State Department. The group’s initial request for documents under the Freedom of Information Act turned up little, but the matter was reopened last year after Mrs. Clinton’s exclusive use of a private email for official State Department business became known.
The depositions have drawn attention to Mrs. Clinton’s use of the server at a time the F.B.I. is completing its investigation into the emails and Mrs. Clinton has tried to keep the focus on her election campaign against Donald J. Trump.
Patrick F. Kennedy, a career foreign service officer who is an under secretary of state for management and operations, testified in the same proceedings on Wednesday. His testimony is expected to be released on Thursday.
Ms. Abedin’s testimony, which lasted five hours, provided few new details about Mrs. Clinton’s use of the private server. She decided to use it when she began the move from the Senate to the State Department after President Obama nominated her to be secretary of state, a position she held from January 2009 to February 2013.
Ms. Abedin herself had an address on the private server, which aides to Bill Clinton maintained at the couple’s home in suburban New York, as well as an official address with the State Department’s system at state.gov.
While she testified that she did most of her email work on the official account, she said that she and Mrs. Clinton used the private server for some government business, as well, especially while traveling abroad.
Ms. Abedin said repeatedly that she gave no thought during her time at the State Department as to how the use of the private email server might affect requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act. She said she did not remember the preservation of records ever being discussed with Mrs. Clinton or with other State Department officials, even after public requests came in.
She said that because most of those emails were State Department-related issues forwarded from her government account, she assumed there was already a record of the exchange in the government account.
“Honestly, I wish I thought about it at the time,” she said. “As I said, I wasn’t perfect. I tried to do all of my work on state.gov. And I do believe I did the majority of my work on state.gov.”
Quizzed about the concerns Mrs. Clinton expressed in 2010 about her personal emails being made public, Ms. Abedin explained that at the time she and others in the department were trying to figure out why Mrs. Clinton had not received an email about a telephone call with Bernard Kouchner, who was then the foreign minister of France.
Ms. Abedin suggested to Mrs. Clinton that she should have a separate BlackBerry for work or post her personal address so that others in the department beyond her inner circle would know how to reach her in the future. In the end, both alternatives were rejected.
That exchange with Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Abedin said, was an occasion when the email arrangement disrupted official business, one of several glitches described in the depositions or the inspector general’s report.
“Just reading the exchange, she seems frustrated because she’s not able to do her job,” Ms. Abedin said, referring to Mrs. Clinton. “I seem frustrated back because I’m not.”
Ms. Abedin said repeatedly that she could not recall specific details about Mrs. Clinton’s email practices and said she was unaware of most of the technical matters involved. She also acknowledged that she refused to speak with the inspector general for its investigation – “on the advice of my attorneys.”
Ms. Abedin, like Mrs. Clinton and others, said she assumed that the use of a private email was allowed, even though the inspector general’s report concluded that no permission was ever sought and it would have been turned down if it had.
Asked why neither she nor other aides to Mrs. Clinton mentioned the private server to State Department officials in charge of preserving documents, she described it as an oversight. “It is not anything that occurred to us,” she said. “We all wish we could go back and that not be the case.”

PARIS — When the bodies of Islamic State fighters are recovered on the Syrian battlefield, the passports found on them have often been stamped in Turkey, which thousands of recruits pass through on their way to join the terror group.
Fighters who call relatives abroad often do so using Turkish cellphone numbers, and when they need cash, they head to Western Union offices in southern Turkey, according to court and intelligence documents.
From the start of the Islamic State’s rise through the chaos of the Syrian war, Turkey has played a central, if complicated, role in the group’s story. For years, it served as a rear base, transit hub and shopping bazaar for the Islamic State, and at first, that may have protected Turkey from the violence the group has inflicted elsewhere.
Now, the Turkish government and Western officials say the suicide bombings at Istanbul’s main airport on Tuesday bore the hallmarks of an Islamic State attack, and they have added them to a growing roll call of assaults attributed to the group in Turkey in recent months.
Analysts said Turkey was paying the price for intensifying its action against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. Under mounting international pressure, the country began sealing its border last year, as well as arresting and deporting suspected militants. And last summer, Turkey allowed the United States to use Incirlik Air Base to fly sorties over the group’s territory in Syria and Iraq.
“Turkey has been cracking down on some of the transit of foreign fighters who are flowing into as well as out of Turkey, and they are part of the coalition providing support, allowing their territory to be used by coalition aircraft,” the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John O. Brennan, said in an interview this week with Yahoo News. “So there are a lot of reasons why Daesh would want to strike back.”
Soon after the government’s decision to allow airstrikes to be carried out from the base in southern Turkey, the Islamic State began naming Turkey as a target, according to Michael S. Smith II, an analyst who closely tracks the group’s messaging. Last fall, the cover of the group’s Dabiq magazine ominously featured a photo of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, standing alongside President Obama.
The attacks attributed to the Islamic State began around then, too, including devastating bombings in the southern city of Suruc in July 2015 and in Ankara, the capital, in October. This year, two suicide bombings targeted tourists in Istanbul.
The Islamic State was blamed for all of those attacks, yet none of them were claimed by the group, despite its habit of reveling in its violence elsewhere in the world. While officials blamed it for the attack on the Istanbul airport, the group’s daily news bulletins for Tuesday and Wednesday made no mention of the bombing. Its main English-language channel on the Telegram encrypted messaging app instead posted a photo essay of fighters in fatigues posing with automatic weapons on a hill in Deir al-Zour, Syria.
Some analysts saw this as the Islamic State trying to have it both ways: punishing Turkey for starting to act against it, but leaving enough of a gray area that it avoids a full-on clash with a country that has been valuable to its operations.
Still, there has clearly been a shift.
“Since mid-2015, a significant rise in pejorative references to the Erdogan government in Islamic State propaganda has indicated Turkey is now in its cross hairs,” Mr. Smith said, adding that this kind of rhetoric also preceded attacks in Western Europe and beyond. “An increase in terrorist attacks in Europe, in North Africa, in Bangladesh and in the Caucasus region were all preceded by increased focus on these areas in Islamic State propaganda materials.”
The group’s long honeymoon with Turkey started with the country’s aid to rebel groups that were fighting the government of Bashar al-Assad of Syria, often with the blessing of Western intelligence agencies, according to analysts. At the start, the Islamic State fit into that category, though it then began focusing more on eliminating competitors than fighting Mr. Assad.
Among the competitors the group was killing were Turkey’s avowed enemies: Kurdish separatists sheltering in Syria and Iraq. Turkey’s Western allies began accusing it of clinging to ambivalence toward the Islamic State. Even when it began strikes against the group last summer, its actions against the Kurds were more numerous and intense.
The centrality of Turkey for foreign volunteers flocking to the Islamic State is evident in court documents and intelligence records. Dozens of young men and women were arrested by the F.B.I. in the United States and by officials in Western Europe after they booked flights to Istanbul. Because so many of the group’s foreign fighters passed through Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport, the destination itself became synonymous with intent to join ISIS.
By 2015, the group was advising recruits to book round-trip tickets to beach resorts in southern Turkey instead, and to be sure to spend a few days pretending to be a tourist as a ruse.
That was the technique used by Reda Hame, a 29-year-old Parisian recruit. He explained to interrogators last summer, after he was arrested upon returning to France to carry out an attack, that he had made sure to buy a package stay at a beach resort in southern Turkey specifically because he wanted to throw off investigators, who knew to look for suspects heading to Istanbul. “I bought an all-inclusive holiday so that I could pass myself off as a tourist,” he said, according to a transcript of his interrogation by France’s domestic intelligence agency in August.
Thousands of pages of investigative documents from the agency, recently obtained by The New York Times, show that nearly all of the recruits arrested by officials in Europe had passed through Turkey on their way to join the Islamic State, as well as on their way back.
Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, said that Turkey also figured heavily in the travel patterns of American adherents trying to join the group.
“The vast majority of American ISIS recruits used, or considered using, Turkey as their route,” said Mr. Hughes, who provided a breakdown showing that, of the 91 people charged with ISIS-related offenses in the United States, 18 purchased tickets through Istanbul, and 15 others either traveled through Turkey or considered doing so.
When Islamic State fighters communicated with worried family members, it was often with Turkish SIM cards. And investigation records reviewed by The Times show that two fighters who were arrested in Austria late last year, and who the police believed were supposed to take part in the Paris attacks on Nov. 13, had been sent money from their ISIS handler through a Western Union office in Turkey.
In his fortified office in northern Syria, Redur Khalil — the spokesman for the Y.P.G., the main Syrian Kurdish group fighting the Islamic State — keeps a stack of passports found on the bodies of the fighters his group has killed. He brings them out for reporters and turns the pages to show the Turkish entry stamps they all bear: proof, he said in an interview last summer, that the terrorist group’s foot soldiers are passing through Turkey.
Islamic State prisoners being held by the Kurds, whom The Times interviewed in the presence of a Y.P.G. minder, all said that they had moved freely across the Turkish border into Syria.
Bulent Aliriza, director of the Turkey Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Turkey and its Western allies had not been quick enough to recognize the threat the Islamic State would pose.
He said that when the rebel groups in Syria began to gain strength, Turkey had nods of approval from the C.I.A. and MI6, the British intelligence agency, to allow arms and volunteers across its border and into rebel camps.
“Where Turkey can be accused of negligence is failing to understand, just as Pakistan did with the Taliban, that these radicals who crossed Turkey to get into Syria would morph into an organization that not only threatened the West, but ultimately itself,” Mr. Aliriza said. “The threat assessment simply did not happen fast enough.”

When the New York City Education Department put a new Success Academy charter school in a building housing a troubled Brooklyn middle school in 2012, many believed the middle school was on its way to closing.
The school, Junior High School 50, known as John D. Wells, had struggled for years. In 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, included it on a list of 94 chronically low-performing schools that the city was infusing with money and social services. Only 49 students were admitted last year.
But instead of dying, J.H.S. 50, in the Williamsburg neighborhood, is showing signs of revival.
A new principal has added programs and activities. The school is hopeful about its performance on this year’s standardized tests. And for the first time in many years, enrollment is expected to increase — 112 sixth graders are registered for September — a sign that parents like what they see happening there.
Now, in a twist, even as it grows, J.H.S. 50 will have to give up five classrooms next year, because the Success Academy school is expanding to fifth grade.
Supporters of J.H.S. 50 are accusing the Education Department of betting against a turnaround. Last year, when it approved Success’ expansion, the department drew up a plan assuming that J.H.S. 50’s enrollment would continue to decline, to as few as 165 students next year. The department is now projecting that the school will have around 230 students. The principal, Benjamin Honoroff, believes that enrollment could be as high as 270, given transfers and so-called over-the-counter students — often new immigrants who arrive in the middle of the year and are assigned to J.H.S. 50 because of its transitional bilingual program.
“We doubled our incoming sixth-grade class,” Mr. Honoroff said. “So I think that an equitable allocation would mean reconsidering some of those decisions.”
City Councilman Antonio Reynoso, who graduated from J.H.S. 50 in 1996, when it had close to 1,100 students, said that when the department made the plan, it promised to adjust it if enrollment increased.
“They said yes, that they would do that, and now we’re facing that issue right now and they’re saying no,” Mr. Reynoso, a Democrat whose district includes Williamsburg, said in an interview.
“They assumed that that wasn’t going to happen,” he added.
Success Academy, through a spokesman, disputed the idea that space was unfairly allocated. The spokesman, Stefan Friedman, said that the charter school expected to add 110 students next year, and that even if J.H.S. 50 reached an enrollment of 270, the two schools would have roughly the same number of students per classroom. He said that the department’s space allocations generally disfavored charter schools, and that several other Success schools in the city had many more students per classroom than traditional public schools in the same buildings.
Over the past two decades, as the surrounding area evolved from a neighborhood of bodegas and discount stores, where half the residents received public assistance, into one of multimillion-dollar apartments and popular restaurants, J.H.S. 50 was largely left behind.
Its students are mostly Hispanic and poor. Thirty-one percent have disabilities, and 29 percent do not speak English proficiently. In 2015, soon after J.H.S. 50 became part of Mr. de Blasio’s school improvement effort, which the administration calls Renewal Schools, only 10 percent of the students passed the state reading tests and only 7 percent passed the math test.
While the Renewal program as a whole has had mixed results, there are signs of progress at J.H.S. 50. The school was paired with a community organization called El Puente, which brought in new staff members to work on improving attendance, increasing parent engagement, training students in conflict mediation, and using art to help students in the bilingual program learn English.
Mr. Honoroff, who became principal last year after working as a literacy coach at the school, instituted new math and English curriculums, added small-group reading interventions for all students four times a week, and made room in the schedule for teachers to meet in teams several times a week to examine students’ work. While scores from this spring’s state tests are not back yet, students made substantial improvement on internal reading tests during the year. Mr. Honoroff has also made debate a major focus, and the school’s debate team recently won a citywide competition.
To tackle its low attendance rate, J.H.S. 50 has paired frequently absent students with staff mentors, who call students or visit them at home when they do not show up and offer positive reinforcement when they do. The rate of chronic absenteeism — the share of students whose attendance is below 90 percent — declined to 31 percent in 2015-16 from 40 percent in 2014-15.
J.H.S. 50 is also using the extra hour that all the schools in the Renewal program have added to their day to make going to school more appealing. Students can choose from a wide variety of extracurricular activities, including robotics, video game design, dance, mural painting, rock band and sports like soccer, baseball and basketball.
Mr. Honoroff is worried about losing dedicated space for some of those activities as the school struggles to fit into a smaller footprint next year. J.H.S. 50 will probably have to turn its dance studio into a regular classroom. It is likely to lose a new computer lab Mr. Reynoso financed. And several rooms will need to do double duty, as both a classroom and a music room, for instance.
To be sure, many schools in the city, both public and charter, struggle with space constraints. And the elementary school to which J.H.S. 50 is losing space, Success Academy Williamsburg, performs much better on state tests. Last year, 80 percent of its third graders — then its top grade — passed the reading tests and 99 percent passed the math tests. (The charter school has more white students and middle-class students, and fewer disabled students and students not proficient in English, than J.H.S. 50.)
One morning last week, Mr. Honoroff pointed out five classrooms assigned to Success this past year that he said went unused and three others that he said were used only sporadically, for occupational therapy.
A spokeswoman for the Education Department, Devora Kaye, said that the department was committed to supporting J.H.S. 50’s growth and that it would review space requirements after enrollment numbers were confirmed in October. In the meantime, she said, the department would help the principal with renovations and room conversions to make the space work this year.
But Mr. Reynoso said that having to squeeze into fewer classrooms could hurt the school’s ability to increase enrollment further.
“We’re about to take away space that they were using to attract parents,” he said.

WASHINGTON — The lusty applause that greeted his return to the Capitol is behind him now, as are the pecks on the cheek he received as he sat at his desk on the Senate floor, looking vaguely glum, receiving good wishes like a warrior returned to civilization, injured but intact.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is back to giving floor speeches deriding the rich and defending those in misery, writing Op-Ed pieces against trade and giving television interviews during which he declines to fully support Hillary Clinton for president. He spent much of Wednesday vigorously denouncing a rescue bill for Puerto Rico that had the support of two-thirds of his fellow senators.
“Let us be clear,” Mr. Sanders said on the Senate floor Wednesday, reviving his familiar Brooklyn-inflected pedagogy. “This issue is a significant part of what the entire debate regarding Puerto Rico is about: Billionaire hedge fund managers who purchase Puerto Rican bonds for pennies on the dollar now want a 100 percent return on their investment, while schools are being shut down in Puerto Rico, while pensions are being threatened with cuts, while children on the island go hungry. That is morally unacceptable.”
Mr. Sanders, who has not withdrawn from the presidential race, has not really left the Democratic primary battlefield. Apparently defeated but decidedly unbowed, he has brought his campaign to Capitol Hill, most visibly in the large security detail that surrounds him as he moves about (“He is very secure,” noted Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina) but also in his comportment with his colleagues.
Eager to expand the left-leaning coalition he has built during his campaign, Mr. Sanders has been pushing his colleagues to take on policy fights that helped propel his base’s passion and gave him new gravitas among Democrats.
In addition to opposing the measure to aid Puerto Rico, he is working hard to kill trade agreements. He is threatening a bill that would govern the labeling of genetically modified food.
“Everyone knows the fervency of his opinions on different things,” said Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader, who, like most senators, was eager to get on with business and out of town for the Fourth of July.
The Democrats with whom the independent Mr. Sanders caucuses have been tolerant of his not-quite-campaign, in no small part because they do not wish to emulate Republicans, whose wounds have been oozing openly. But many Democratic colleagues, especially the women, are growing weary of his progressive lectures that seem more fit for a dais than a lunchroom encounter, and his unwillingness to energetically back Mrs. Clinton.
“He feels he has a duty to his followers to raise the flag on the issues they care about,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. “We are all being patient, and we’re all hopeful he’ll be on the campaign” for Mrs. Clinton.
For now, Mr. Sanders seems to be adjusting — if slightly mournfully — at the fork in the road between kind-of former candidate and definitely current senator. He walks through the halls at times emulating Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whose shoulder he gave a squeeze as he bounded through the basement of the Capitol on Wednesday, brushing off reporters with a wave. At other times he becomes chatty again, talking about legislation he despises. “I’m sure it’s really hard on him,” said Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California. “Losing is awful.”
He has his eyes on the senior Democratic slot on the Senate’s high-profile Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions — as of late very bipartisan — to the dismay of Republicans, who prefer Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the committee, and even some Democrats, who fret that Mr. Sanders might try to push the committee to the left on several issues.
“If the opportunity were to arise,” said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, “he would be proud to chair that committee, which deals with so many issues of vital importance to the American people.” The decision is Ms. Murray’s to make.
Others said they can already see Mr. Sanders’s influence on Democrats. “He has made a big splash,” Mr. Scott said. “So his influence can be seen on Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and over the last few months up here, especially on the banking committee, he has moved people to the left.”
Mr. Sanders clearly wants to work with Democrats to put together legislation that reflects his priorities — like affordable college — while still working to get much of his agenda in the platform of the party to which he does not belong for its convention next month.
“As he has said many times, however, he does not believe real change is going to take place until a political revolution occurs and millions of people stand up and fight for their rights,” Mr. Briggs said.
For now, Mr. Sanders’s campaign has given him newfound clout among Democrats. But he risks losing some if he does not endorse Mrs. Clinton soon, and he is still working to figure out how to spend his capital in a caucus where he lacks many close friends.
“Bernie is going to do what Bernie’s going to do,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, “and the only thing I think is that it should be something constructive and helpful to the ticket.”
Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, recognizes that Mr. Sanders’s appeal is valuable to the party and will try to harness it, while attempting to convince him that uniting around Mrs. Clinton is the best way to defeat Donald J. Trump in November. “In our caucus,” Mr. Schumer said, “the general view is that Bernie is a constructive force.”

The Yankees find themselves at a precarious moment, facing a crossroads just up ahead. With a short winning streak — just a tick above mediocre — they could feel like contenders. With a long patch of losing, they could be forced to confront a harsh new reality.
Their victory on Wednesday — a 9-7 comeback thriller over the Texas Rangers — might have been their biggest of the season. Alex Rodriguez said it was. Didi Gregorius, who ended the game with a line drive over the right-field fence, would not go there.
“The biggest is yet to come,” Gregorius said. “We’re playing better. A lot of stuff is going to happen, and we’re going to play better baseball from now on.”
The Yankees can only hope so, because they still must reveal their true identity before the Aug. 1 trading deadline. They are 38-39 and leave for a 10-game road trip after Thursday’s matinee. They trail by three and a half games for a wild-card berth.
Every team below the Yankees — Oakland, Tampa Bay, the Angels and Minnesota — is hopelessly out of it. But a victory like Wednesday’s, when they trailed by five runs in the eighth, validates the Yankees’ belief in their progress.
“We haven’t been playing our best baseball this year,” said Brian McCann, who homered in the eighth and ninth. “But at the same time, we dug ourselves a hole early in April and we’re getting out of it right now. We’ve just got to continue to play good baseball.”
They can also cling to the math. The last two times the Yankees had a losing record at this point, in 1995 and in 2007, they rallied to reach the playoffs. Two summers ago, the Kansas City Royals were two games under .500 on July 21. Three months later, they hosted Game 1 of the World Series.
The Yankees constructed this team with a late-game bullpen that could mimic those Royals, protecting leads after six innings with an overpowering trio of relievers. Getting leads, of course, has been the problem. The Yankees’ aging and fragile lineup has rarely shown that it can handle good pitching.
Like the Mets, whose persistent story line is the health and workload of their young rotation, the Yankees tackle the same tiresome topic every day: How do they deal with this or that veteran who is injured, or slumping, or both?
Carlos Beltran was out of the lineup Wednesday with a sore right hamstring, which had forced him from Tuesday’s game and will probably sideline him Thursday, too. Rodriguez, who is hitting .213, got a rare start against a right-handed pitcher and went 0 for 5. Mark Teixeira, who is recovering from a cartilage tear in his right knee, had a scheduled day off.
“If I overdo it, I’m going to be on an operating table,” Teixeira said. “I’m going to need a day here and there. It’s a little sore. We’re just going to keep managing it.”
A dash of hope, it seems, could come from outfielder Aaron Judge, who is hitting .395 with seven homers in his last 10 games for Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. But the Yankees said Judge, 24, was not quite ready.
“The minor league people are trying to finish this kid off,” Manager Joe Girardi said Wednesday afternoon, “so when and if he gets here, he’s here to stay.”
The Yankees held tight to Judge and their other prospects last July, and the aggressive Blue Jays raced past them to win the A.L. East. The Rangers used their deep prospect pool to trade for an ace, Cole Hamels, and bullpen help. They also sprinted to a division crown, and were the first A.L. team to 50 victories this season.
“We have a tremendous front office that is always looking for talented players, and they’re not afraid to take some risk along the way,” Rangers Manager Jeff Banister said. “They’re not afraid to really push some of the younger, talented players. They’ve been bold.”
The Rangers, like the Yankees, have several players with nine-figure contracts. But they also have a wave of productive young position players — Nomar Mazara, Rougned Odor and Jurickson Profar, who are all younger than Judge — and made the bargain signing of the winter by getting Ian Desmond for one year and $8 million.
The lack of dynamic, inexpensive talent is by far the Yankees’ biggest problem, and the one that, in theory, could be helped by trading a reliever — Andrew Miller, Aroldis Chapman or both. Five division leaders — San Francisco, Washington, the Cubs, Texas and Cleveland — all have glaring bullpen needs.
But Miller is signed for two more years. Chapman could return as a free agent or bring back a high draft pick if he rejects a qualifying offer. The Yankees would need to exceed the value of that pick to trade Chapman — and to do it, they would also have to sink deep enough in the standings to make the rest of this season worth punting.
The Yankees are not there yet, but time is running out for the rally that would save their season. Wednesday was a start, but it might just be prolonging an illusion.

WASHINGTON — A self-described conservative North Carolina businessman has promised to spend at least $5 million through his political action committee to back five Republican congressional candidates who have supported taking action to curb climate change.
Even as his party’s presumptive presidential nominee denies the existence of global warming, the businessman, Jay Faison, and his ClearPath Action Fund will spend at least $2 million on digital media campaigns to defend Senate incumbents running in two of the tightest races in the country, Rob Portman in Ohio and Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, a recognition of the senators’ support for clean energy, Mr. Faison said Wednesday. The advertisements are expected to start running this week.
ClearPath is also spending several hundred thousand dollars on digital advertising campaigns to support Representatives Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Tom Reed and Elise Stefanik of New York, all Republicans running for re-election in similarly tight races.
“What we’re trying to do is prove to the party, through these races, that clean energy wins races, to build a political safe space for the Republican Party to talk about this,” Mr. Faison said in an interview. “It is difficult for a politician to consistently act in an area with no reward. We have their back.” He added, “We’re also making that case to the Trump campaign.”
The spending comes as Republican leaders have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change and attacked President Obama’s climate change policies. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive nominee, has mocked climate science and vowed to cancel the Paris Agreement, the 2015 global accord committing nearly every country on earth to taking action to fight climate change.
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, calls Mr. Obama’s climate policies a “war on coal.” But some Republican members of Congress who hope to carve out careers that could outlast Mr. Trump’s have begun to quietly consider how to address climate change, which they believe resonates with a growing segment of voters, particularly young people.
Political strategists are paying attention to polls that show Americans expressing record- or near-record-high belief that global warming is happening. A March Gallup poll found that 64 percent of American adults worry “a great deal” or “a fair amount” about global warming, the highest number since 2008, and it found that a record 65 percent of Americans attribute global warming to human activity.
However, most polls asking voters to rank the importance of issues find that environmental concerns trail far behind concerns about jobs and the economy.
Still, in many campaigns, Democrats are attacking Republicans as climate deniers.
Some moderate Republicans hope to use their views on climate change to draw a contrast with Mr. Trump.
“All of them need to demonstrate a level of independence from the national party in order to survive,” said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, speaking of the five lawmakers backed by Mr. Faison’s group. “They’ll need to declare independence from Donald Trump.”
In 2015, Ms. Ayotte broke with her party to vote against a measure written by Mr. McConnell that would have blocked Mr. Obama’s climate change rules. She also voted for a program to establish grants to schools for climate change education, against a proposal to block the Obama administration from signing on to the Paris climate change accord, and in favor of a federal fund to respond to the threat of climate change.
Mr. Portman voted with his party on most of those measures, but also voted in favor of the fund to respond to climate threats. He has worked for years with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, on a bill to improve energy efficiency in buildings. He is a former board member of the Nature Conservancy and is a co-author of legislation to support cleanup of the Great Lakes.
The three House members backed by Mr. Faison’s group are among just 13 Republicans who have signed on to a resolution, offered by Representative Chris Gibson, Republican of New York. “The resolution was a vehicle to find out which Republicans were willing to step up and take some action,” said Steve Valk, a spokesman for Citizen’s Climate Lobby.
But while those five Republicans’ environmental records stand out from many in their party, they have voted more times against environmental regulations than in favor. The League of Conservation Voters, which tracks lawmakers’ environmental records on a scale of 1 to 100, have given lifetime scores to Ms. Ayotte of 35 percent, Mr. Portman of 20 percent, Mr. Curbelo of 23 percent, Mr. Reed of 6 percent and Ms. Stefanik of 9 percent. “To give House Republicans like Elise Stefanik, Tom Reed or Carlos Curbelo credit for acknowledging that climate change is real is a very low bar,” said Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
In Miami, Mr. Curbelo’s opponent, Annette Tadeo, a Democrat, has slammed his climate positions as hypocritical. “Big oil and gas lobbyists have been filling his campaign coffers with thousands of dollars in cash, in exchange for his advocacy for offshore drilling,” she said in a statement.
In Ohio, Mr. Portman is fighting to keep his seat against a former governor, Ted Strickland, who notes his support of Mr. Obama’s climate plan and slams Mr. Portman for voting against it.
In upstate New York, a local newspaper, The Post-Star, noted that Ms. Stefanik’s support for the climate change resolution was paired with votes against Mr. Obama’s climate change plan. “We were especially interested in how she could acknowledge climate change in one stand, yet vote to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan (new standards for coal-burning power plants), especially while representing a region that was devastated by acid rain from those plants in the Midwest,” the paper’s editorial board wrote.
Some political observers have drawn comparisons between Mr. Faison and Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist and Democratic donor whose political action committee, NextGen Climate Action, has spent heavily to push candidates who champion climate change issues. Mr. Steyer emerged as the single biggest political donor of the 2014 cycle, spending $74 million to influence voters, far more than the $5 million pledged by Mr. Faison’s group. Mr. Steyer, whose group has already laid out plans to spend at least $25 million in 2016, disavowed the comparison to Mr. Faison.
“From what we can tell by the people he is supporting, he is grading Republicans on the curve,” Mr. Steyer said in an interview. “We have fairly objective standards for grading people, and none of the them come close to meeting our standards.” Mr. Steyer said his group planned to support the Democratic Senate candidates in Ohio and New Hampshire.
And while the ads run by Mr. Faison’s group note the candidates’ support of clean energy, showing lush green fields and sparkling blue skies, they never explicitly mention the term climate change. Mr. Faison acknowledges that while he supports Republicans who have supported climate change policy, it is still too politically divisive to actually use the phrase.
“Climate change is a divisive term on the Hill and it’s a divisive term among the electorate,” said Mr. Faison. “But ‘clean energy’ tells a voter you care about the environment, and deflects attacks about climate change.”

WASHINGTON — Does the European Union have a democracy deficit?
Leaders of the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union have proclaimed last week’s historic vote as a victory for democracy. The union, they often argue, is elitist and undemocratic. The only way for member states to regain full control is to quit outright.
The reality is more complicated. Scratch the surface, and it becomes clear that neither the European Union’s very real problems nor the criticisms of the bloc are really about anything as straightforward as elections or representation. This is a debate about democracy, but in a way that is both more meaningful and harder to define than how we usually think of it.
Technically, the European Union has quite a lot of democracy going on.
The European Parliament, often referred to as the “lower house” of the union’s legislature, is directly elected, via free and fair elections in the 28 member countries, every five years. Every European Union citizen of voting age is entitled to cast a ballot to select a representative. The legislature’s 751 seats are apportioned by the bloc’s treaties.
The Council of the European Union, or “upper house,” consists of representatives sent by the governments of member states. They are not directly elected, but the governments that send them are. Likewise, the members of the European Council, which sets the European Union’s policy agenda, are the elected leaders of member states.
These bodies, in turn, appoint and confirm a number of civil servants, as well as members of groups such as the European Commission. While these officials are both powerful and unelected, the process is not different from many democracies. The United States, for example, does not directly elect its secretary of state or, for that matter, any State Department functionary.
So while defenders of the European Union have evidence to show that the bloc is democratic, this misses the point. Democracy, after all, is about more than elections. It’s also about accountability: whether the government is responsive to the citizenry.
Yes, the European Union has elections (and, yes, like the United States, participation has been less than 50 percent for many cycles). But, in a functioning democracy, popular will is also expressed through mechanisms other than marking ballots.
The European Union, perhaps in part because it was designed by technocrats rather than developing organically, does not account for or often even allow those mechanisms. And this is why, for many Europeans, the body does not feel democratic.
Some of this is by design. Although its legislature is elected, the union is in many ways a technocracy first. It was designed to be an institution that allows experts to make the best decisions possible, simultaneously rising above and defusing nationalist politics.
The ultimate goal of the project has always been a peaceful, united Europe. Protection from politics was supposed to help achieve that. Nationalist rage, after all, once allowed the rise of fascists and Nazis. The European Union was designed to prevent that from happening again.
But politics has its benefits. It’s an avenue by which people can express their will and institutions can respond; this, in some ways, is what real democracy is all about.
Day-to-day politicking is often treated as an unseemly distraction from the “real” work of legislating. But while politics isn’t always a pretty process, it is an essential one.
In democracies, when there is a contested issue, elected officials and interest groups from all sides argue it out in public view, in the media, on the floor of the legislature or both.
Even if your side loses, you have seen the process play out, and maybe even participated in it by signing a petition or attending a protest. You feel included because your representative argued for your interests. If your lawmaker didn’t do that, you can vote him or her out, but you don’t need to throw out the whole system.
The European Union doesn’t work like that, so it doesn’t feel as democratic. Its decisions seem remote, its leaders unreachable. So when people are unhappy with Europe’s decisions, it is easy for them to believe that it’s because Europe — some vague, amorphous body — did not listen to them, and perhaps does not even care about them.
That sentiment has led to “Euromyths,” a genre of urban legends about European regulations that gained traction during the British referendum campaign. One claimed that London’s beloved double-decker buses were to be banned, another that “fish and chips” would have to be written in Latin on menus, another that bananas would be required to be straight.
The subtext of those stories was that the European Union was not only threatening British culture, but doing so carelessly — that the Brussels bureaucrats imposing those regulations didn’t care or maybe even understand that their decisions would take away something culturally important, and that there was no way for ordinary citizens to reach or influence them.
Those feelings apply to more important decisions too: migration and financial bailouts for troubled member states, to name a couple. People in Britain and other countries, feeling that the European Union is blithely ignoring their political will, have responded by expressing that will more forcefully than ever.
The union was designed to overcome national politics, but has actually fostered more of it — much as the historian Tony Judt predicted in a 1996 essay that now seems chillingly prescient.
“We may wake up one day to find that far from solving the problems of our continent,” Mr. Judt wrote back then, “the myth of ‘Europe’ has become an impediment to recognizing them.”
The thing that makes this problem so severe is not that the European Union is too strong, but that it is too weak.
Consider the unfolding migrant crisis.
Because the union lacks institutions muscular enough to either design or implement a Europe-wide policy, its officials have resorted to begging and cajoling member states to voluntarily resettle more refugees — and those states have largely refused. The resulting compromises haven’t made anyone happy, and have left certain states, particularly Greece and Italy, bearing the brunt on their own.
Such compromises compound the sense that the bloc does not represent actual Europeans. Negotiations that attempt to balance the interests of more than two dozen distinct societies often yield unsatisfying solutions.
This feels undemocratic because someone in, say, France, sees that European Union policy differs from the French national will.
That feels like French democracy is being overridden by a remote, unresponsive entity, and there is nothing the French can do about it.
So member states end up inevitably thwarting one another’s democratic desires: The people of Greece want something different than do the people of Germany. But Greece is affected by Germany’s policies, and vice versa.
As long as the European Union is strong enough to put them in conflict but too weak to create a solution, it will feel, in some sense, undemocratic.

URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/sports/cycling/in-return-to-tour-de-france-tejay-van-garderen-aims-for-the-podium.html

Tejay van Garderen was in third place over all in the Tour de France a year ago, with just a handful of stages between him and a podium place in Paris, when he pulled to the side of the road and climbed into his team car.
A respiratory infection he had been fighting for days had forced him out of the race.
It was a bitter disappointment not only for van Garderen, who has twice finished fifth in the Tour, cycling’s marquee race, but also for American fans waiting for someone to step into the void left by Lance Armstrong.
Perhaps this is the year that will finally happen.
Van Garderen will join four other Americans on the start line Saturday in Mont-St.-Michel, all of them with the ability to stir things up. In fact, van Garderen and the Australian Richie Porte were picked as leaders of the BMC Racing Team, which means that van Garderen, a 27-year-old from Tacoma, Wash., will have plenty of support.
“I’ve already raced the Tour de France a couple of times with most of these guys, so I couldn’t be happier to line up with them once again,” van Garderen said. “I’m in great shape. I’m really motivated.”
Van Garderen withdrew his name from consideration for the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, citing concerns about the Zika virus, with his wife due to give birth in October. That means the Tour is his sole priority.
He will be joined at the Tour by his BMC teammate Brent Bookwalter, who will be part of the two-man United States squad in Rio. Cannondale Pro Cycling also has two Americans, Lawson Craddock and Alex Howes, while their teammate Andrew Talansky is skipping the race because of family concerns and a chronic sinus infection.
Peter Stetina, with Trek-Segafredo, rounds out the American contingent. Stetina, who sustained career-threatening injuries in a crash in the Tour of the Basque Country last year, may have the best feel-good story in the peloton.
There are two more Americans than there were a year ago, when the fewest in nearly two decades made it to the start. But the total down from 10 just five years ago.
For various reasons, several of America’s brightest stars are joining Talansky on the sideline.
Taylor Phinney is not part of BMC’s roster, setting his sights instead on the Olympics, where he has a chance to win a medal in the time trial. Tyler Farrar, a stage winner in 2011, was passed over by his Dimension Data team, and Ben King was skipped over by Cannondale despite a strong performance in the Tour of California.
Still, those on the start list for the Tour have enough ability to make good on their aspirations.
Van Garderen is a legitimate podium threat, especially after his recent stage win in the Tour of Switzerland. Bookwalter has a chance to win from a breakaway. Stetina will focus on helping his Dutch teammate Bauke Mollema in the hills but proved at the Tour of California that he could pull a surprise on any uphill stage.
Craddock, a bright-eyed Texan, and Howes, who, like Stetina, grew up in the cycling hotbed near Boulder, Colo., are intriguing youngsters who believe they have something to prove.
“With it being my first Tour, it’s hard to place certain expectations on myself,” Craddock said. “Just lining up on the start line of the Tour is a dream come true, so if I were able to wear a jersey there, then I think my mind would just explode. That being said, I’m a born and bred bike racer, and I line up to every race I do with dreams of winning. I’m not just going to the Tour to be pack fodder.”
Jonathan Vaughters, who founded the United States-based Cannondale team, said that the French veteran Pierre Rolland would be the pivot point of his squad. But he did not dismiss Craddock, 24, or Howes, 28, especially given their charmingly cavalier attitudes.
“The anticipation of this race is huge,” Craddock said. “I imagine the few days leading up to the start, I’ll have a few more nerves than normal, but at the end of the day, it’s just another bike race. The neutral flag goes down on the first stage, I’m sure those nerves will be replaced with pure adrenaline.”

CLAIREFONTAINE, France — Like a theater audience demanding to be entertained, French soccer fans can be a fickle lot.
The team will be hoping that the mercurial tradition does not re-emerge on Sunday when it takes on Iceland in the quarterfinals of the European Championships. Iceland, after all, is extremely popular among neutral fans after its 2-1 victory over England in the round of 16.
Les Bleus, as the French team is known, have often endured a fractious relationship with their fans. Relations are better, but still precarious.
Last weekend in Lyon, the players were jeered off at halftime while trailing Ireland by 1-0. In the group game against Albania in Marseille, the vocal frustration was evident until Antoine Griezmann’s 90th-minute goal.
Any frayed nerves among the French contingent on Sunday at the Stade de France just north of Paris will surely contrast with those of Iceland’s devoted fans, who will be shouting their traditional Viking chant and cranking up the pressure on France’s players.
Ideally for France, a quick goal or two would help settle their nerves.
France’s failure to score during the first half in games at the tournament may not be just a coincidence. Players start games nervously, as if trying to avoid mistakes. Chances are snatched at, the body language is tense and cagey, the fans rarely indulgent.
“I think we should be a bit more supportive,” Ahmed Kchikech, a French fan, said after the team held a public training session on Wednesday. “We’re fed up with things only happening in the second half.” He added: “French fans are like this. We don’t forgive the slightest mistake.”
Kchikech said he envied the way Ireland and Iceland supported their teams at the Euros, with prolonged chants and heartwarming songs.
“It’s magnificent, but that’s not the French way,” he said.
Over the years, games have often mapped out the same way at the national stadium. A flag-waving rendition of “La Marseillaise” is followed by some hearty early encouragement and then a tense, watchful silence. If France fails to impress, jeers and boos ring out from the stands.
The French players have often spoken about being upset during games when the fans turn. Speaking after a 2-0 defeat to Argentina in 2009, left back Patrice Evra berated French fans for sarcastically supporting Argentina.
“All the matches we play in France feel like they’re away from home,” Evra said.
There’s little doubt that the French team has not always helped itself — notably at the World Cup in South Africa in 2010, when the players went on strike.
Things have improved, especially in November 2013, when France overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit against Ukraine to win, 3-0, at the Stade de France and qualify for the World Cup.
Since Didier Deschamps took charge as coach after the Euros in 2012, he has opened up more training sessions to the public.
On Wednesday, about 500 fans attended a training session at France’s base at leafy Clairefontaine on the outskirts of Paris. Deschamps and the players happily signed autographs and chatted with fans before training.
On Sunday, they are likely to be hoping that they remain supportive.

The most serious charges against the violinist Stefan Arzberger, who had been accused of trying to strangle a fellow guest in a Midtown hotel, were dismissed Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Arzberger, who had faced a charge of attempted murder, instead pleaded guilty to a less serious charge of reckless assault in the third degree, and was given an unconditional discharge. He faces no jail time or fine.
The decision leaves Mr. Arzberger, a violinist for the Leipzig String Quartet whose passport was confiscated, free to return home to Germany after a 15-month ordeal.
Mr. Arzberger, 43, had been accused of barging naked into the room of a 64-year-old woman at the Hudson Hotel, where he was staying while on tour in March 2015, and trying to strangle her.
But his lawyers said he had been drugged by a prostitute who Mr. Arzberger had brought to his room earlier the same night and who they later learned was a man.
Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass told the court that his office had agreed to drop the most serious charges for a number of reasons including a lack of discernible motive for the alleged attack, and the wishes of the victim, who prosecutors said had not objected to the decision.
Mr. Arzberger, who lives in Germany, was forced to stay in the United States while the charges were pending. His lawyer, Nicholas Kaizer, could not say what his immediate plans were. Mr. Arzberger still faces a civil suit brought by the woman, Pamela Robinson, of Asheville, N.C.
In a statement, Mr. Arzberger’s publicist said that the musician “is very pleased with the outcome of this case and looks forward to moving forward with his life.”

MEXICO CITY — Judges here have temporarily halted the extradition of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo, pending the outcome of appeals filed this week by Mr. Guzmán’s lawyers.
The appeals argue that the statute of limitations has run out on some of the crimes that Mr. Guzmán is accused of committing, his lead lawyer, José Refugio Rodríguez, told The Associated Press. They also argue that some of the accusations are based on hearsay rather than direct evidence, the lawyer said.
Two district appellate judges ruled that the appeals, which were filed in two courts on Monday and seek to block extradition requests by prosecutors in California and Texas, could go forward. Stays in Mexican extradition cases are nearly automatic, a courts official said, and the appeals process could take months, if not years, to run its course. The judges’ decisions were published Tuesday.
Mr. Guzmán faces various criminal charges in several American jurisdictions, including murder, drug trafficking, money laundering and arms possession. He is currently imprisoned in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juárez, but American officials would like to see him in custody in the United States as soon as possible, to ensure that he can be prosecuted and, they say, to significantly lower the chances of his escape, a skill he has ably demonstrated.
After a 2001 escape from Mexican custody, he remained on the run until his capture in 2014. He fled again a year later, bolting through a mile-long tunnel that led from his prison cell to a warehouse. After his recapture in January, the Mexican government finally decided to accede to a longstanding American request for extradition.
Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Relations approved the extradition in May after receiving guarantees from the United States that Mr. Guzmán would not face the death penalty. Mexico, which has abolished capital punishment, refuses to extradite its citizens if they would face possible execution in the receiving country.

Residents of Kansas, Georgia and Alabama will have to prove they are citizens when registering to vote for federal elections using a national form, a judge ruled Wednesday. Judge Richard Leon of Federal District Court sided against voting rights groups that sued a federal elections official who changed the proof-of-citizenship requirements on the federal registration form at the request of the three states and without public notice. Residents of other states need only to swear that they are citizens. The judge refused to issue a temporary injunction sought by voting rights advocates to overturn the move by Brian Newby, executive director of the United States Election Assistance Commission, until the case can be decided at trial. The groups said Mr. Newby’s February action contradicts the commission’s mission to provide an easy form to encourage voter registration. They argue the proof-of-citizenship requirements hurt their ability to conduct registration drives and deprive eligible voters of the right to vote. (AP)
Kaya Henderson announced Wednesday that she is stepping down Oct. 1 after more than five years as chancellor of the District of Columbia’s public schools, ending a tenure that included improvements in standardized test scores but a stubborn achievement gap between black and white students. Ms. Henderson, 45, succeeded the polarizing Michelle Rhee, and she continued her predecessor’s aggressive education-reform policies. But she had a more low-key style and better relationships with parents, teachers and elected officials. Ms. Henderson has fired hundreds of teachers under a system that evaluates them in part based on their students’ test scores. City students have improved their performances on federal standardized tests, but the achievement gap between white students and non-Asian minorities has remained persistently high. Ms. Henderson said she was “ready to take on new challenges.’’ (AP)
Two people were found dead Wednesday in a fire-stricken area near San Diego, the authorities said. The unidentified man and woman were found near a boulder in Potrero, about 45 miles east of San Diego, Jan Caldwell, a spokeswoman for the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department, said. The property had been under evacuation orders after a fire began on June 19 and has since spread to nearly 12 square miles. The medical examiner will determine the cause of death. (AP)

UNITED NATIONS — Saudi Arabia should be ousted from the United Nations Human Rights Council for its unlawful killings of civilians in Yemen, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said jointly on Wednesday, an unusual demand meant to draw attention to one of the world’s most powerful countries, embroiled in one of the world’s most brutal wars.
The chances of that happening are slim to none. The suspension of any country from an elected body of the United Nations is extraordinary, and it would be all the more so for a country with powerful friends like the United States. The proposal would need a two-thirds majority vote in the 193-member General Assembly.
Libya was the last country suspended from the Council, which is responsible for promoting and protecting human rights. The General Assembly approved its ouster in 2011, after protesters were met with violent reprisals by the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Saudi Arabia is another matter. It was elected to the 47-member Human Rights Council in 2013. Since then, it has beat back efforts at the Council to create an independent commission of inquiry to look into human rights abuses in Yemen.
Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia persuaded the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to remove the military coalition it leads in Yemen from a list of armies that kill and maim children. Mr. Ban had included the coalition for its attacks on schools and hospitals in Yemen, but agreed to remove it from the list temporarily. Mr. Ban told reporters that he had been coerced — a charge the Saudis flatly denied.
There was no immediate comment from the Saudi mission in response to the call by the human rights groups. Its three-year term on the Council concludes at the end of 2016. It remains to be seen whether it will seek a second term, and how other countries will react.
The coalition began intervening in the Yemeni civil war last year after Shiite rebels known as Houthis drove President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile. The Houthis are said to be supported by Iran, Saudi Arabia’s bitter rival in the Persian Gulf.
At a news conference at United Nations headquarters, researchers with Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said the Saudi-led coalition had broken international law with at least 69 airstrikes targeting civilians, some of which could amount to war crimes, and accused it of using banned cluster munitions.
The two groups called for “credible investigations that meet international standards” or an agreement by Saudi Arabia to cooperate with an independent international inquiry.
The groups also say that the United States, which provides refueling and targeting assistance to the Saudi-led coalition, could be liable for war crimes in Yemen. They also cited Saudi Arabia’s treatment of its own citizens, including sentencing people to death for crimes that are not punishable by death under international law.
Saudi Arabia is not the only country on the Human Rights Council with a questionable human rights record. Venezuela also has a seat on the body.
But Philippe Bolopion, the deputy advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, said, “Saudi Arabia is really in a league of its own because of the crimes it has committed.”

Claim to Fame Mr. Santos is a founder of Homepolish, a two-year-old start-up that offers personalized interior design services by the hour through its network of 500 designers. The idea is to make interior design more accessible and affordable (a three-hour single-day session is $349). Homepolish recently raised $20 million in funding led by Andy Hunt, a founder of Warby Parker. Clients have included the Goop offices and web-savvy tastemakers including Leandra Medine, Patrick Janelle and Danielle Snyder. “They have enough money, but they don’t have enough time,” Mr. Santos said of his clients. “They want to be engaged in design, but they don’t want to execute it themselves.”
Big Break After quitting an interior design firm in 2011, Mr. Santos, who studied business and architecture at Stanford, started a one-man firm called 50 for Fifty, which offered 50-minute design consultations for $50. The New York magazine design editor Wendy Goodman heard about it and featured his two-bedroom apartment in Murray Hill as a Space of the Week in 2012. His future business partner, Will Nathan, saw the article and hired Mr. Santos to redo his one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea. They started Homepolish soon after.
Latest Project Mr. Santos recently designed the SoHo loft for the Sweetgreen founders Nathaniel Ru and Jon Neman. The two-bedroom bachelor pad has lots of plants, daybeds, midcentury modern furniture and open spaces for parties. He is also working on his own two-bedroom apartment near Gramercy Park, which he moved to last October.
Next Thing The firm is moving to a 12,000-square-foot office in the Flatiron district in September, and recently started a Shopping List feature that allows them to take advantage of trade discounts at West Elm, Restoration Hardware and other retailers.
Home Makeovers Mr. Santos wants his clients to look at their homes as they do their wardrobes, as “a constant reflection of where you are in life,” he said. “It’s always evolving, as your personal style and tastes evolve, and is never completely finished. It should reflect who you are and how you want to live at all points in your life.”

BANGOR, Me. — Pressing his staunch opposition to trade deals, Donald J. Trump escalated his attacks on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, saying it was “totally controlled by the special interest groups.”
“They’re a special interest that wants to have the deals that they want to have,” he told a packed arena at a rally here, to whoops and cheers. “They want to have T.P.P., the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the worst deals, and it’ll be the worst deal since Nafta.”
The remarks criticizing the Chamber were yet another manifestation of the divide between the Republican economic orthodoxy that embraces all trade, and the nationalistic anti-trade policies Mr. Trump laid out in a major speech Tuesday in a Pittsburgh suburb.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is often a strong ally of Republican candidates, spending more than $35 million in the 2014 midterms in support of them. But it has also been sharply critical of Mr. Trump’s views on trade, and has frequently posted articles critical of him on its blog, including one Tuesday night on its website titled, “The 2013 Trump Was a Lot Better on Trade Than the 2016 Version.”
Mr. Trump first responded to the group on Twitter Wednesday morning, but he escalated the attacks at his rally here, saying the Chamber was “controlled totally by various groups of people that don’t care about you whatsoever.”
A spokeswoman for the Chamber, Blair Latoff Holmes, defended its position on trade.
“The U.S. Chamber represents American businesses of all sizes from across the country, who recognize that free trade agreements, like the T.P.P., are an important way to accelerate economic growth and spur job creation in the U.S.,” she said.
“This is not personal,” Ms. Holmes added. “It’s not election politics. It’s smart policy.”
Mr. Trump’s remarks on the Chamber were the latest in a string of comments that have further divided those in the Republican ranks as he seeks to rally the party behind his campaign after a particularly contentious nominating fight.
That bruising battle was still on Mr. Trump’s mind Wednesday. He spent several minutes riffing on the “pledge” that Republican candidates all signed early in the primary contest to ultimately rally behind the party’s nominee, whoever was chosen.
“They broke their word, in my opinion,” he said. “They should never be allowed to run for public office again, because what they did is disgraceful.”
But while he spent the majority of his speech highlighting his trade policies and themes from his economic speech on Tuesday, he largely shied away from talking about the terrorist attacks in Istanbul later that day, although he noted how they seemed to overtake the news of his speech.
“I gave a speech in Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania yesterday, and it was very well received,” Mr. Trump said. “Then you had the tragedy in Turkey, and that was the end of that speech, which was fine.
“That’s the way it’s supposed to be because that tragedy is a disgrace, that we can allow that to continue to go on whether it’s Turkey or anywhere else. That’s a disgrace.”
But while he pledged to fight the Islamic State and terrorism, he also professed a dovish foreign policy in an attempt to contrast himself with Hillary Clinton.
“They say, ‘Oh, can we trust Donald with a button?’ ” Mr. Trump said, adding, “I would be the slowest with the button, but I would be the one that doesn’t have to use it because they’re going to respect us again.”

The scoring-starved Devils acquired a former No. 1 overall draft pick, two All-Star defensemen switched places, and one of the N.H.L.’s most prolific scorers indicated he had decided to stay put on a busy Wednesday, two days before the start of the free-agent signing period.
The Devils acquired Taylor Hall, the top pick in the 2010 draft, from the Edmonton Oilers for defenseman Adam Larsson. Montreal sent defenseman P. K. Subban to Nashville for Shea Weber, and Steven Stamkos signed an eight-year contract extension with Tampa Bay.
Hall, who had 132 goals and 196 assists in 381 career games with the Oilers, will provide much-needed scoring punch for the Devils. Last season, he had 26 goals and 39 assists and represented the Oilers in the All-Star Game.
Larsson had three goals and 15 assists while playing in all 82 games last season as part of the Devils’ top defensive pairing.
The biggest trade of the day, however, involved the Canadiens and the Predators.
Subban, who won the Norris Trophy as the N.H.L.’s top defenseman in 2013, had six goals and 45 assists last season before sustaining a neck injury in March.
Montreal General Manager Marc Bergevin said trading Subban was “one of the most difficult decisions” he had had to make.
“We completed today an important transaction, which I am convinced will make the Canadiens a better team,” Bergevin said.
A clause in Subban’s contract that would have allowed him to block any trade was set to kick in on Friday.
Nashville General Manager David Poile praised Subban’s “tremendous skill and contagious energy” and said he would make the Predators a better team now and into the future.
“Superstar defensemen of his caliber are a rare commodity, and we are thrilled to add him to the organization,” Poile said.
Weber, a three-time Norris Trophy finalist, was a team captain and had 20 goals and 31 assists last season for Nashville. He had signed a 14-year, $110 million offer sheet with Philadelphia as a restricted free agent in 2012, but Nashville matched it and kept him.
Bergevin said Weber would improve Montreal’s power play and play a leadership role for the Canadiens.
“He is a complete rear guard with impressive size and a powerful shot,” Bergevin said.
Stamkos, a two-time N.H.L. scoring champion for the Lightning who would have been able to test free agency starting on Friday, wrote on Twitter that he was “excited to be back for 8 more years.”
The deal, worth $68 million, was reached two days before Stamkos would have been able to gauge his worth on the open market. Stamkos, a four-time All-Star with 312 goals, was expected to command far more lucrative offers from numerous bidders, including his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs, the Buffalo Sabres and the Detroit Red Wings.
“It’s not often that a player gets the chance to spend his career in one organization, and I am hopeful that this agreement sets me on that path,” Stamkos said.
The agreement was something of a surprise after Stamkos and the Lightning had been unable to negotiate a contract extension during the season.
His status even loomed over the N.H.L. draft last weekend in Buffalo, where several team executives expressed their interest in making a bid to sign Stamkos. Sabres General Manager Tim Murray was among them and referred to Stamkos as “the big fish.”
But Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman remained hopeful that a deal could be reached, saying as recently as Saturday that he had not closed the door on re-signing Stamkos.
The Lightning had a slight edge over other teams, however. Under N.H.L. rules, they were allowed to sign Stamkos to an eight-year contract while other teams were limited to making seven-year offers.
Stamkos has topped 40 goals four times. He has won the N.H.L.’s regular-season scoring title twice, including the 2011-12 season, in which he had a career-high 60 goals.
Stamkos is coming off a year in which he had 36 goals and 64 points in 77 games before having surgery on April 4 to treat a blood clot near his right collarbone. Stamkos did not return until he saw limited ice time in Tampa Bay’s 2-1 loss to Pittsburgh in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals.
In other moves, the Sabres signed defenseman Casey Nelson to a two-year contract extension; St. Louis signed forward Kyle Brodziak to a two-year extension; Minnesota re-signed left wing Jason Zucker to a two-year, $4 million contract; and Columbus signed defenseman Seth Jones to a six-year, $32.4 million contract.

For decades, the southwest corner of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue was Bill Cunningham’s main perch.
Over the years, he had gone everywhere in the city one of his 30 bicycles would take him. Up to the Botanical Garden, down to the Christopher Street piers and over to Tompkins Square Park.
But Fifth Avenue remained for him the greatest place in the world, an intersection where East met West, uptown met downtown, publishing types in pencil skirts met Chanel-clad socialites, and black met white.
Mr. Cunningham loved himself a parade, the bulk of which seemed to take place there. That’s where Puerto Ricans headed the second week in June, decked out in red, white, blue and everything in between. A few weeks later, he’d head back for the gay pride parade.
He never seemed to miss St. Patrick’s Day, when he could be spotted amid the sea of white and green wearing his trademark uniform — a blue French worker’s jacket, his khaki-colored pants and black sneakers.
So when Mr. Cunningham died Saturday after becoming an actual living landmark, it made sense that this was where mourners headed, right by the windows at Bergdorf Goodman, where the store installed a special display in his honor, showcasing a bicycle, a black Nikon camera and a background painted what the store’s longtime style maven, Linda Fargo, described as “Bill Cunningham blue.” On the curb, some put up white flowers. Others left notes.
During his later years, people told him how much they admired him, and how they read his columns religiously and devoured the documentary about him. “I think it embarrassed him,” his friend Cecilia Dean said. “He was unbelievably gracious, but you could tell how uncomfortable he was with it.”
Now he is gone, and they are still paying tribute.
There’s a petition at Change.org to designate the location “Bill Cunningham Corner.” It’s already received more than 3,200 signatures. According to WWD, the designer Jeffrey Banks has started another campaign to get a sculpture of Mr. Cunningham placed on the corner.
On Thursday, a private funeral will be held, with a memorial expected in the coming weeks. This Sunday, The New York Times Styles section will pay tribute to a man who never would have asked for it, but whom so many want to honor nevertheless.

SYDNEY — Political donations by mining companies preceded legislative approval for several Australian mining operations, including plans to develop the country’s biggest coal mine, according to a report by an independent Australian policy institute released on Thursday.
The report, by the Australia Institute, examined six cases where mining companies made donations to Australia’s major political parties and received favorable legislation for mining projects in the state of Queensland.
The report contends that the donations from the mining industry bought access to Queensland state officials, giving the industry an “undue influence on our democratic processes” and resulting in decisions that “have poor outcomes for our environment, economy and our communities.”
“Taking money from mining companies undermines the integrity of political decision-making,” Mark Ogge, the report’s co-author said in an interview. “It should be illegal. It is a conflict of interest.”
The report, written with the Australian Conservation Foundation, was released two days before Australia’s national elections, which are Saturday. While the timing appears intended to highlight the influence of the mining industry in politics — Australia’s campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of donations to major parties until months after the fact — the report does not refer to any contributions in the current election.
The report’s primary focus is on the Liberal National Party, led by Campbell Newman, which governed Queensland from 2012 to 2015, and his successor, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of the Labor Party, who took office there in 2015.
Queensland is home to several large and contentious mining projects, including in the Galilee Basin in central Queensland. Two new mines there could add an additional 120 million tons a year to Australia’s thermal coal exports.
One of the mines would be Australia’s largest and, environmentalists say, will damage the Great Barrier Reef.
The project’s developer, the Adani Group, a conglomerate based in India, donated $52,139 to the Queensland Liberal National Party and to the federal Liberal Party of Australia, from 2012 to 2015, the report said.
The report said Adani officials met with Anthony Lynham, the state’s minister for natural resources and mines, at least seven times and had 12 other meetings with state ministers in 2013 and 2014.
In late 2014, the government of Queensland agreed to invest up to $220 million in rail and port projects to support the new mine. It also changed the legislation to remove the right of the community to object to mining projects, the report said.
The Adani project was approved by Ms. Palaszczuk’s government, and included a plan approved by the federal environment minister, Greg Hunt, a Liberal Party member, to allow bigger coal ships to dock at the port of Abbot Point within the Great Barrier Reef on Queensland’s northeast coast. The plan called for the dredging of the port to accommodate larger ships, with the spoils dumped near the reef.
After an outcry from scientists and legal action by conservationists, the dredging decision was reversed. The dredge spoils will now be dumped on land.
But the report said Adani’s donations had “influenced the approval process, encouraging successive governments to ignore concerns regarding their suitability to operate.”
Ms. Palaszczuk defended her government’s actions, saying it had lowered the reporting requirement for political donations to $738 from $9,458, making government more transparent. And in a written statement, a spokesman for the Queensland government said it had restored laws to allow communities to weigh in on proposed mining projects.
The spokesman said the approval process for mining projects was extensive and transparent. It includes public consultation, environmental impact studies and strict conditions to protect the environment. Mine lease applications must also meet public interest requirements.
The mines minister for Queensland, Anthony Lynham, was on vacation and was not available for comment. Adnani officials did not respond to a request for comment.
The Adani case was just one example cited in the report.
Two oil companies, Beach Energy and Linc Energy, and the mining companies Karreman Quarries and New Hope Coal also made donations, according to the report, which says the companies received favorable treatment in return. Another company, Sibelco, spent money campaigning to support its sand mining operations ahead of the state election.
A spokeswoman for Sibelco, Helen Stanley, said the company had made no direct donations to political parties but had funded an electorate campaign in support of its sand mining operations on North Stradbroke Island. She said the campaign was run in 2013. In 2015, the Palaszczuk government said it would end sand mining on the island by 2019.
Beach Energy, Karreman Quarries and New Hope Coal did not respond to questions. Linc Energy is in receivership, a company spokeswoman said, adding she could not answer questions about the company’s political donations policy.
Over all, the report said, the Queensland Liberal National Party received more than $700,000 in donations from mining companies from 2011 to 2015. The mining industry also donated nearly $2.2 million to the federal Liberal Party of Australia, which now leads the national government, in the five years since July 2011. The Queensland Liberal National Party and the Liberal Party of Australia are not one and the same.
The Queensland Labor Party received $68,000 and the federal Labor party received $890,000 from donors connected to the mining industry over the same period.
A spokesman for the Liberal Party said in a written reply on Wednesday that he would not comment on a report he had not read, but pointed out that the Australia Institute, a research center, employed former Greens Party supporters in important roles.
Large mining projects often require state and federal government approval, especially if threatened species and their habitats are placed under duress by the proposed operation.
“The report demonstrates that money doesn’t just buy access, it buys outcomes,” said Lindy Edwards, a political scientist from the University of New South Wales. She said state laws around political donations should be overhauled, “at the federal level, the secrecy is so bad it is almost impossible to uncover corruption.”
Donations to any political party higher than $9,774 must be declared on the Australian Electoral Commission’s public register. But those declarations are made months after the money changes hands. Funds donated to the federal Liberal coalition, Labor party or Greens party leading up to national elections on Saturday will not be made public until February 2017.
Also, it can be difficult to track how much money and when a donor made a contribution.
The report cited the meetings that mining company executives had with senior politicians based on minutes from ministers’ diaries, which are publicly available.
“A farmer whose ground water is about to be drawn down or whose land is about to be polluted rarely has the money to secure that sort of access,” Mr. Ogge said.
Ms. Edwards said many factors determined whether a mine gained approval. “Royalties from the mine to the state government, jobs, the state’s economic welfare are all factors,” she said. “But there is an issue around ensuring that everyone’s voice is heard. Mining companies should not get better access to government decision makers than people in the community, who are concerned about the environment.”

Tarantulas know how to fight. Many of these arachnids defend themselves by launching javelin-like hairs from their abdomens at potential attackers. But a newly discovered member of this family prefers to settle its confrontations up close.
This is Kankuamo marquezi, and it jabs its butt bristles, or urticating hairs, straight into its foes.
“Urticating hairs are used as defense against natural enemies,” Carlos Perafán, a biologist from the University of the Republic in Uruguay, said in an email. “These hairs are different from hairs covering the body of tarantulas because they have a penetrating tip, which allows the hair to embed in the skin or mucous membranes and cause irritation.”
Scientists had previously identified six types of urticating hairs on tarantulas. Kankuamo marquezi adds a seventh. Its hairs are the second example of a defensive hair that is released on contact, while most are projected when a tarantula flicks its legs against its rear, sending a flurry of barbs into the air.
Kankuamo marquezi’s derrière defenses are different enough that they not only classify the spider as a new species of tarantula, but also a new genus as well, which is the next classification up in taxonomy. Mr. Perafán said the discovery raises questions about the evolutionary pressures that caused the spiders to develop their rear-end spikes.
He and his colleagues found the new arachnid while exploring the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range in Colombia. They described it in a paper published Wednesday in the journal ZooKeys.
They named the species after Gabriel García Márquez, the Nobel-prize winning author of the book "One Hundred Years of Solitude” who lived in Colombia, and its genus after the Kankuamo, which are indigenous people who inhabited the eastern slopes of the mountain range where the tarantula was found.

Less than a year since he stepped down as the chairman of Carnegie Hall after clashing with its staff, Ronald O. Perelman, the billionaire businessman, announced Wednesday that he was donating $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.
His donation immediately catapulted the long-stalled performing arts center, one of the last major pieces of unfinished business at the World Trade Center site, from aspirational to achievable and places him among a new generation of power brokers and billionaires who are reshaping — and renaming — the cultural infrastructure of New York. In recognition of his gift, the new theater complex, which will sit on one of the most emotionally resonant and most visited spots in the city, will be named for Mr. Perelman.
“I think that this is a project that must happen,” Mr. Perelman said in an interview, adding that he had been drawn to it by the vision of the role that art could play at the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and in the continuing rebuilding of the area. “It is more than just a pure artistic center to serve a community. It is that, but at the same time it’s much more than that.”
In the last few years, the city’s wealthy elite have chiseled their names into some of the city’s most iconic cultural institutions — or sought to build their own. The New York Public Library’s main branch on Fifth Avenue has been renamed for Stephen A. Schwarzman, the old New York State Theater for David H. Koch and Avery Fisher (nee Philharmonic) Hall at Lincoln Center for David Geffen.
The new Perelman center is also joining several other projects that are being planned, including Culture Shed, a performance space at the Hudson Yards on the West Side, and a new park on Pier 55 near 14th Street with three outdoor spaces underwritten by the billionaire Barry Diller. Some arts executives have questioned whether the city had the audiences and donor base to sustain so many new cultural spaces.
But culture has long been envisioned as a key part of the rebuilt World Trade Center and was an important feature of the architect Daniel Libeskind’s 2003 master plan for the site. The performing arts center was placed on the back burner, though, as officials wrangled over the many other thorny issues involved in redevelopment. Groups including the old New York City Opera, the Signature Theater Company and the Joyce Theater all explored anchoring the new complex, but nothing came of it. The architect Frank Gehry was hired to design it, then his design was shelved. The project, which was championed by the Bloomberg administration and eagerly sought by downtown residents, was kept alive through the administrations of four governors and two mayors.
The seeds of Mr. Perelman’s involvement were planted a decade ago when Michael R. Bloomberg, who was the mayor, became the chairman of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum to restore confidence in the project, which had gone off track. Mr. Bloomberg recalled in an interview that one of the first donors he turned to was Mr. Perelman, who quickly agreed to donate $5 million to the museum project. Mr. Perelman stayed involved, expressing enthusiasm for the idea of a performing arts center at the site, and, as the project finally took shape recently, he agreed to make the lead gift.
“Perelman’s a funny guy — if he’s interested in the institution and its mission, he’s a very easy sell,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “There have been times I had to sell him when he didn’t care very much, and that took a little more work.”
The backers of the new Perelman center downtown see it as filling an important niche for a midsize theater that can accommodate the kinds of multidisciplinary works many artists experiment with today. The complex, which is being designed by REX, a Brooklyn-based architecture firm, is to include three flexible, technologically advanced theaters that can individually seat 499 people, 299 people and 100 people, and which can be combined into one space that can accommodate 1,200. The plan calls for the center to present or produce dance, concerts, new or early chamber opera, and theater, and to become the main venue of the Tribeca Film Festival each April.
The performance plans have yet to come fully into focus: David Lan, the artistic director at the Young Vic in London, did a stint as its temporary artistic director, and Jenny Gersten, a former executive director of Friends of the High Line and artistic director of the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, is a producing consultant. But the presence of Mr. Perelman, a hard-charging businessman who is known to favor a hands-on approach with groups that he supports, suggests that there will be a powerful, wealthy patron pushing for it to succeed.
Mr. Perelman left Carnegie after spending less than a year as its chairman after clashing with its staff and other board members — and before making an additional donation to the hall that had been expected to be in the $30 million range. He said in the interview that his support of the new performing arts center was unrelated to his departure from Carnegie and that he probably would have made the donation to support the new complex in any case.
With Mr. Perelman’s donation, the project is now well on its way to covering its estimated $240 million price tag, said Maggie Boepple, the center’s president and director. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation committed $100 million in federal funds awarded after the Sept. 11 attacks for the project’s design, construction and administrative costs.
“Ronald’s gift is going to open the doors,” Ms. Boepple said. “We have some other donors in the wings.”
Mr. Perelman, who raised eyebrows with his call to stage more pop music at Carnegie Hall, said that he envisioned attracting a wide variety of artists. “I would hope it is the first venue of choice for the Bruce Springsteens and the Bon Jovis and the Yo-Yo Mas and the Lang Langs, and at the same time it’s a place where we could have produced a “Hamilton” project or where we could produce a new ballet,” he said. He added that he was excited by the technological possibilities of the plans, which call for adding cutting-edge streaming capabilities that will allow the center to capture and disseminate performances in a much more immersive, sophisticated way than is done at most theaters.
Mr. Perelman said that he had been particularly taken by the designs of the architect, Joshua Prince-Ramus, who was formerly a partner of Rem Koolhaas, and recalled a recent meeting in which they went over the renderings of the complex, which have not yet been publicly released, and then discussed the technological possibilities with Nicholas Negroponte, a founder of the MIT Media Lab, who had been visiting Mr. Perelman on other business.
The news that the performing arts center finally had a lead gift, and was likely to get built, is sure to cheer downtown residents who have long seen it as a priority, said Catherine McVay Hughes, the chairwoman of Community Board 1. “The community that stayed was steadfast in supporting a cultural component,” she said. “It was important that something alive gets created here, right here, at the World Trade Center site.”

Miss Teen USA is getting rid of swimsuits and swapping bikinis for athletic wear starting with the next pageant, on July 30.
The switch is aimed at “highlighting a healthy lifestyle” for younger viewers, said Michael Antinoro, the head of original content at IMG, a talent agency that last year bought the Miss Universe Organization, including Miss Teen USA, a contest for 14- to 19-year-old girls, from Donald J. Trump.
But there are no plans to remove the controversial, skin-baring display from the organization’s competitions for adult women, Miss USA. and Miss Universe, he said in a telephone interview.
“For Miss Universe and Miss USA, that’s a very important part of the competition and will continue to be an important part of the competition,” Mr. Antinoro said.
Replacing the teenagers’ swimsuits with athletic wear — which he defined as clothes the contestants might wear to the gym or yoga class — should not be seen as “anti-swimsuit,” he said. Whether through swimsuits or athletic wear, the aim is to “celebrate being healthy, and being in shape and being comfortable in your own skin,” he added.
It’s part of a continuing effort to distance the pageants from their roots: a competition based entirely on the contestants’ appearance. In recent years, organizers have sought to focus on the offstage lives of the women and girls, pushing their accomplishments and charity work, but criticism remains steady.
“Although pageant officials and contestants emphasize scholarships, talents and platform issues and repackage the swimsuit competition as the ‘lifestyle and fitness’ category, their rhetoric rings hollow,” Blain Roberts, a historian, wrote in 2013.
“Beauty pageants should go the way of the corset,” Courtney E. Martin, an author, wrote the same year “They’re outdated and restrictive and perpetuate a damaging link between real world success and a woman’s capacity to cultivate a very specific, stereotypical definition of beauty.”
Paula Shugart, the president of the Miss Universe Organization, said in a letter to state directors this week that the pageant was “committed to continuing to evolve in ways that celebrate women’s strength, confidence and beauty for years to come.”
“This decision reflects an important cultural shift we’re all celebrating that empowers women who lead active, purposeful lives and encourage those in their communities to do the same,” she wrote.
“Our hope is that this decision will help all of Miss Teen USA’s fans recognize these young women for the strong, inspiring individuals they are.”
Julianne Hough, a host of Miss USA 2016, told USA Today that she understood the resistance to the swimsuit portion of the pageant, but defended the segment as being similar to going to the beach.
“There is the whole thing of being confident in the fact you worked hard to get that body and you go to the gym and you eat healthy and do certain things,” she said. But, she added, “In the next few years, we may grow from that.”
The Miss World pageant ended its swimsuit competition in 2014.
“It’s not just a beauty contest; it’s ‘beauty with a purpose,’ ” Chris Wilmer, the national director of Miss World America and Miss United States, told ABC News. “There didn’t seem to be a purpose to have the swimsuit.”
Mr. Trump sold the Miss Universe organization to WME-IMG in September after two television partners dropped the competition in response to his comments about illegal immigrants.

Environmental attack. Free radical assault. Noxious gas: From some dire beauty headlines of late, you’d think the very air was contriving, if not to kill us, then to make us look older.
Scientists are just beginning to uncover how toxic air affects the skin’s aging process. A study done this year on data from subjects in Germany and China appeared to link increased air pollution to brown spots on the skin.
And not surprisingly, the big beauty players are stepping in with new skin care products — “pollution protection,” as it’s called.
So what exactly are we protecting ourselves against?
Ozone, the toxic gas formed when UV light hits mono-nitrogen oxides (basically, combustion exhaust), is suspected by some to be one of the primary causes of pollution-related skin damage. (Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs UV rays, and so is protective against skin cancer. But ground-level ozone has been linked to respiratory problems.)
We are continuously exposed to ozone, said Dr. Giuseppe Valacchi, an associate professor in physiology at the Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology at the University of Ferrara in Italy, who is known for his expertise on pollution’s effect on the body. “It’s as if ozone were designed specifically to injure our skin.”
The outer layer of our skin contains lipids — that is, fats that bind skin cells together. Ozone oxidizes those lipids, Dr. Valacchi said, causing inflammation, breaking down the barrier function of the skin and activating a cascade of DNA-damaging events. What to do?
“You can protect yourself from UV damage with sunscreen, but sunscreens aren’t effective for pollution,” said Dr. Gilly Munavalli, medical director of Dermatology, Laser & Vein Specialists of the Carolinas in Charlotte, N.C. “The best thing we can do now is apply antioxidants: vitamins C and E.”
So beneficial antioxidants may already be part of your skin care routine.
Moreover, subverting air toxins can be as simple washing your face with the right cleanser. Particulate matter, the tiny harmful particles in the air, attaches to the skin as you go about your day. But it isn’t immediately damaging.
Dr. Carl Thornfeldt, the founder of the Epionce skin care line, who has studied skin barrier function for more than 20 years, said, “Use cleansers that will wash off all the bad molecules but not strip key oils.” Aveeno Ultra-Calming Foaming Cleanser ($7.99 at ulta.com) and Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser for Sensitive Skin ($7.99 at drugstore.com) produce minimal damage to lipids, Dr. Thornfeldt said.
Doctors say that a routine of antioxidants, cleansing and barrier repair is the best defense against air pollution.
“People forget that the main goal of our skin is to be an immune barrier,” said Dr. Anne Chapas of Union Square Laser Dermatology in Manhattan. “So the main goal is to keep things out of the body. If you have a compromised skin barrier, it’s letting things in.”
Among the skin care ingredients to consider are glycerin, lanolin, niacinamide and beeswax.
The pollutants we encounter every day may be largely inescapable, but there’s ample reason to be defensive in our skin care routine. Here are eight products that may help.
Dr. Jart-Plus Every Sun Day Sun Fluid
Sunscreen alone won’t protect the skin from all pollution damage. This formula ($34 at sephora.com), from the Korean brand Dr. Jart, claims to have the same electrical charge as dust particles in the air, therefore repelling them and creating a protective field. Bonus points for a quick-absorbing, moisturizing finish.
Coola Sport SPF50 Sunscreen Spray
Skin on the body is less susceptible to pollution than skin on the face is. “We mainly have sebum [oils] in our faces — not too much in other parts of the body,” Dr. Valacchi said. “And since it’s the ozone-sebum interaction that makes toxic molecules, damage is less likely there.” But that doesn’t mean one should skimp on protection. This sunscreen from Coola ($36 at coolasuncare.com) contains antioxidants. “We say apply sunscreen every 80 minutes, especially if you’re out in the sun,” Dr. Chapas said. This way, when you reapply sun protection, you get a boost of antioxidants as well.
Kayo Daily Vitamin Boost
Kayo, a new brand based in Malibu, Calif., makes what it calls “face grade” premium body care. Use its body antioxidant formula ($56 at kayobetterbodycare.com) as you would a face serum: Add several drops to your sunscreen or moisturizer. Vitamins C and E are the main antipollution ingredients in this mix of hydrators and collagen-boosters.
Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins Mega-Defense SPF 45 Advanced UV Defender
Containing extracts from a Brazilian cactus, this mineral sunscreen is said to create a physical barrier that protects skin from airborne particles ($41 at origins.com). It also claims to trigger the production of hornerin, a protein that aides epidermal function.
Elizabeth Arden Prevage City Smart
This tinted cream ($68 at elizabetharden.com in July) is a good cosmetic choice, too. Light diffusers blur blemishes, and its dewy texture makes it a good base layer for fresh-faced makeup.
Restorsea PRO IntensiveTreatment 10X
AA2G, a stabilized form of vitamin C, is one of the main ingredients in this skin-smoothing, anti-aging treatment ($195 at restorsea.com for doctors). Restorsea says it has a proprietary enzyme that digests only dead skin cells for exfoliation without irritation.
Epionce Renewal Facial Cream
This moisturizer ($94 at epionce.com) has ingredients said to be both barrier-repairing and anti-inflammatory, like meadowfoam, apple and avocado extract. “When the barrier is compromised, it causes inflammation, too,” Dr. Thornfeldt said. “You’ve got to control that.”
Skinceuticals TripleLipid Restore 2:4:2
Formulated specifically to repair barrier function, this cream ($125 at skinceuticals.com) replenishes cholesterol, ceramides and fatty acids, all of which are depleted as the skin barrier is compromised.

When Glasslands Gallery, the influential independent club on the Williamsburg waterfront in Brooklyn, closed at the end of 2014, its owners had already been thinking about what was next.
The partners — Rami Haykal, 28, and Jake Rosenthal, 29 — had booked shows and worked at the ragtag D.I.Y. space since college, taking over the lease in 2011. Along with their friend Dhruv Chopra, 29, who had advised at Glasslands, they were plotting an expansion to a larger room with the same grass-roots ethos when Glasslands fell victim to the Williamsburg real estate trends it helped catalyze: Vice Media, which outgrew the same punk spirit, took over the building.
So the young events entrepreneurs broadened their ambitions and embarked on a much more daring project: a new music and arts space measuring 24,000 square feet. It will include two performance rooms of different sizes, an art gallery, a loft bar and cafe with daytime service, and an open rooftop for D.J. sets and film screenings.
Dubbed Elsewhere — “It sounds like what we want the place to be: an alternative,” Mr. Rosenthal said of the name — the arts compound is in industrial Bushwick, deeper into Brooklyn on the L train, and is largely being built from the ground up in a converted warehouse at a cost of $3 million. (Its opening is planned for the fall.)
Such an undertaking, with its angel investors and adherence to building codes, may seem at odds with the do-it-yourself principles that pervade the world of semi-underground clubs in New York, known for their shaky floors and questionable legality. But those scrappy places are also fleeting, prone to sudden closure — the independent clubs Santos Party House and Palisades are the latest to fizzle — precisely the fate Elsewhere is preparing to avoid.
“Why did Glasslands disappear? Because a lot of the fundamentals of what it means to be a business in New York City weren’t really planned,” Mr. Rosenthal said. “That’s a good thing — it gave us the experience that we had there. But it’s gone now, and there’s a reason. We’re trying to build a space that artists and audiences can enjoy for a longer period of time.”
Mr. Chopra, who has a background in investment management, added, “The whole scene is realizing that now: This city is just naturally forcing people to evolve if you want to be sustainable.”
With the New York events scene increasingly dominated by megaconcert promoters like Live Nation, the founders of Elsewhere are hoping to fill a local void as a spacious, professionally run indie venue, with plans to book a majority of shows there through their own production company, PopGun Presents.
This week, a construction crew was noisily at work on the still-skeletal building, pouring cement and transporting mounds of dirt and rocks amid exposed wires and laid-out blueprints. But the shape of the labyrinth-like complex was beginning to reveal itself as a potential playground for emerging artists across mediums and the parade of Brooklyn showgoers hoping to get sweaty and dance.
On a tour of the space, its owners enthusiastically pointed out the planned amenities that will separate Elsewhere from its D.I.Y. predecessors: industrial air conditioning, a sizable coat-check area, multiple bars — and plentiful bathrooms, a necessary corrective to the dispiriting toilet scene at Glasslands.
“Part of the mandate of the project is to try to keep the spirit but fix the problems and operational headaches,” Mr. Rosenthal said, adding that the owners are “thinking about simple ways to make it a better experience” and reducing “the little frustrations of being at a crowded music venue in New York City.”
Still, the look of the place will be minimal, the owners said, because they chose to invest more in “creative infrastructure” — lights, stages, sound systems, artist green rooms — than interior design.
Programming will be crucial. Glasslands was known for its early support of rising indie acts like Grimes, FKA twigs, Disclosure and Frankie Cosmos; Elsewhere hopes to expand its genre boundaries, embracing more hip-hop, folk, house and techno, its owners said.
Above all, they hope the new venue will be a reliable community gathering place for those invested in alternative culture — but in a more grown-up package.
“This place isn’t going to fall apart,” Mr. Rosenthal said, recalling the “sense of chaos and impending doom” that came with running a space like Glasslands. “It’s not necessarily that it needed to be bigger and have better finishing or nicer wallpaper. It’s mostly that we wanted to set up a thing that could last.”
But the extra bathrooms don’t hurt.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, put himself in charge of a new governing agency created during a meeting of his country’s rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People’s Assembly, on Wednesday.
The Assembly revised North Korea’s Constitution to create what the state media called a Commission on State Affairs, with Mr. Kim as its chairman. It replaces the National Defense Commission, the most powerful governing organ under Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, who ruled North Korea until his death in 2011.
Mr. Kim’s new title was the latest in a series of top leadership roles in the military, party and government that he has acquired to establish his one-man rule.
Before his death, Kim Jong-il ruled North Korea as chairman of the National Defense Commission. Although the commission was originally created to oversee military affairs, he used it as his primary governing agency under his “military first” policy, which focused on the development of nuclear weapons and promoted the priorities of the Korean People’s Army in economic and other policy decisions.
Since taking power, Kim Jong-un has engineered a series of purges and filled the top posts in the party and military with loyalists, regaining influence over the military.
Compared with the military-oriented National Defense Commission, the newly created commission is broader, including key party and cabinet figures as members.
In the congress of the Workers’ Party in May, Mr. Kim was appointed chairman, a new post created to replace the title of general secretary that his father had held when he was the party boss.
The congress also adopted as a key national strategy Mr. Kim’s “byungjin” policy, which seeks economic development while continuing to expand the country’s nuclear weapons and missile capacities.

NAIROBI, Kenya — The day started like any other for Willie Kimani, a Nairobi lawyer. He put on his gray trousers, jungle-green jacket and black shoes. He said goodbye to his wife and two young sons. And he walked out the door.
But what came next was like something out of a thriller movie — one with an unsettling end — and has mobilized Kenya’s lawyers, roped in several Western embassies and set off loud alarm bells in Kenya’s human rights community.
Last Thursday, Mr. Kimani, who has worked as a human rights defender since he graduated from law school five years ago, accompanied a client to trial in a case involving a police officer.
After a couple of witnesses testified, the case was adjourned a little before noon. Mr. Kimani and his client left the courthouse, on the outskirts of Nairobi, in a taxi.
Then they disappeared.
Mr. Kimani, an investigator with an American legal aid group, had been working on the case of a young motorcycle taxi driver who had been shot in the arm, apparently accidentally, by a police officer last year.
The driver, Josephat Mwenda, filed a complaint against the officer, who has not been publicly identified. The officer and his colleagues retaliated by pursuing false charges against Mr. Mwenda, including drug counts and accusations of petty crimes like riding a motorcycle without a helmet, according to human rights activists.
Still, Mr. Mwenda was reluctant to drop his complaint, and human rights advocates urged him to resist what appeared to be a pattern of police intimidation and harassment.
Around 4:30 p.m. Thursday, after the men had left the courtroom and no one had been able to reach them, Mr. Mwenda’s wife received a strange phone call, colleagues say.
A passer-by happened to see two men, maybe more, locked in a metal container on a police base yelling through a barred window for help.
The men threw out a note scribbled on toilet paper. The note was from Mr. Mwenda. It said: Call my wife. I’m in danger.
That is the last anyone has seen or heard from Mr. Kimani, Mr. Mwenda or the taxi driver, human rights advocates say. Their phones abruptly went dead on Thursday night. Police officers at the base where the toilet paper note was reportedly thrown out the window denied ever seeing the three.
Early the next morning, the taxi was found more than 30 miles away, parked on a road in a deserted, misty tea plantation, with the doors locked.
Many of Mr. Kimani’s colleagues now fear that police officers may have killed the three. And while Kenya is widely known as corrupt and violent, and is dogged by a long history of impunity, the brazen disappearing of a witness, a taxi driver and a well-known human rights defender is considered far beyond the norm in this country.
“That could have been me,” said Jeremy Chabari, a young Kenyan lawyer.
Kenya is no Rwanda, Ethiopia or Democratic Republic of Congo, places where dissidents are routinely locked up or worse. Kenya is considered one of the most progressive and open democracies in Africa. But this case is seen as a chilling setback in the battle to clean up the Kenyan police services.
“It’s astonishing that a lawyer with international human rights connections can be ‘disappeared’ in a country which enjoys strong international support and is subject to close Western scrutiny,” said Salim Lone, a former official in Kenya’s leading opposition party who now lives in New Jersey.
On Wednesday, several dozen young lawyers, immaculately dressed in suits and equipped with the latest smartphones, stood on the steps of Kenya’s Supreme Court to deliver a set of demands. The lawyers called on the government to immediately open an independent investigation and make a full report public by next week.
Charles Kanjama, the chairman of the lawyers’ group, said that the case had caused “great, great concern to the entire legal fraternity” and that the circumstances were “very suspicious.”
Kenyan police officials have said little, except that the investigation is being handled by an elite unit known as the Flying Squad, which is widely suspected of engaging in extrajudicial killings in the past.
The Flying Squad has been checking phone records and looking at footage from roadside surveillance cameras to identify where the three might have been taken. Human rights activists predicted that several officers, including the one involved in the original shooting, would soon be arrested.
The International Justice Mission, the American legal aid group that employed Mr. Kimani and has been representing Mr. Mwenda in his court cases, is a well-connected Christian organization. Within hours of the three men vanishing, the American Embassy in Nairobi received several messages from Washington asking diplomats to look into the case.
“We are heartbroken by this horrific targeting of our staff and are doing everything we can to locate these men,” said Claire Wilkinson, the group’s director in Kenya.
American law enforcement agents based in Nairobi are assisting in the investigation, and American diplomats, along with counterparts from Britain and several other Western nations, are pressuring high levels of the Kenyan government to take the case seriously. The American government provides millions of dollars of security assistance to Kenya each year, including training and equipment to police officers.
One American official said the Kenyan police clearly still had problems and that continued cooperation would be influenced by how much improvement the Kenyans actually make.

“Have you ever been hit?” a man named John asks his caregiver in “Cost of Living,” a new play by Martyna Majok. “That’s what it’s like,” he continues. “Like people hitting me from beneath my skin.”
John, a Ph.D. candidate in political science, has cerebral palsy. So does Gregg Mozgala, who portrays him in this Williamstown Theater Festival production running through July 10. Ani, another character, is played by Katy Sullivan, a professional actress who is a Paralympic medalist. Their casting — in a high-profile production that will end up at the Manhattan Theater Club — is a visible sign of change when it comes to performers with disabilities, who rarely appear onstage, even as stories of disability offer rich and, yes, prize-generating material for actors.
Ms. Sullivan, who was born without lower legs, doesn’t believe that able-bodied performers should be prevented from playing the disabled. She sees acting as “putting on someone else’s soul, putting on someone else’s life experiences and trying to be truthful about them, whether you’re disabled or not.” Still, she noted, “Using performers with disabilities brings a layer of authenticity that you don’t have to go searching for.”
The Deaf West Theater production of “Spring Awakening,” which earned enthusiastic reviews when it played on Broadway last season, may have excited new interest in casting actors with disabilities. The recently announced Broadway revival of “The Glass Menagerie” will co-star Madison Ferris, an actress who uses a wheelchair, as Laura Wingfield. “I Was Most Alive With You,” which just ran at the Huntington Theater Company in Boston, was written by Craig Lucas expressly for the deaf actor Russell Harvard.
This is not exactly business as usual. The past several Broadway seasons have included shows like “The Cripple of Inishmaan,” “Richard III,” “Of Mice and Men,” “The Elephant Man,” “Side Show” and “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.” In these plays and musicals, able-bodied actors played characters with physical or cognitive disabilities. Other recent “Glass Menagerie” revivals have cast actresses who can leave Laura’s limp at the stage door. (Representatives for the coming production declined to comment on its casting.)
Recent conversations around this issue, in film and television as well as in theater, have become more contentious, with comparisons often drawn to traditions of blackface. As the journalist Frances Ryan wrote in an opinion piece for The Guardian last year, “Perhaps it is time to think before we next applaud ‘cripping up.’ Disabled people’s lives are more than something for non-disabled actors to play at.”
Or, as Howard Sherman, the interim director of the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts, put it: “Playing someone with a disability should not be considered a talent or a skill for nondisabled actors. It should be considered taking a job away from someone with the unique life experiences to portray that role.”
The language around these issues is also fraught. If “disabled” remains the standard term, some artists and activists resist its connotation of impairment. (Many who are deaf would argue against deafness being construed as a disability, for example.) The term “differently abled” is a common alternative, though some prefer more individual vocabulary.
Ali Stroker, the “Spring Awakening” performer who was said to be the first actress in a wheelchair to appear on Broadway, occasionally heard discouraging words.
Ms. Stroker, who said she was also the first actor in a wheelchair to graduate from New York University’s rigorous theater training program, recalled a casting director telling her, “This is going to be very hard for you.”
“Perfect,” Ms. Stroker said. “My life has been hard. I don’t like easy things.”
She added: “My experience of having a disability my entire life was perfect training for this industry. I’m used to hearing no. I’m used to being creative when someone has closed a door.”
But how many doors are open even now? With the exception of theaters like Deaf West, Theater Breaking Through Barriers and the Apothetae (founded by Mr. Mozgala) — created in part to provide opportunities for artists with disabilities — and companies like the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, which has committed to integrating disabled actors, most able-bodied roles go to able-bodied actors.
And many disabled roles still go to able-bodied actors, too. Sometimes this is necessary, as in roles that show gradual deterioration or unexpected recovery, or roles that call for a rare physical type, like the conjoined twins of “Side Show.” Sometimes it isn’t.
There has been controversy, for example, regarding the casting of Christopher in “Curious Incident,” a young man whose behavior places him on the autism spectrum. Some have used social media to pressure the producers to make auditions more accessible and welcoming to autistic actors. As the actor Mickey Rowe wrote in an email, “All too often we learn about autism from non-autistic people instead of going straight to the source.”
Mr. Harvard, a deaf actor often cast in deaf roles, appears the exception. In addition to his theater work, which included a starring part in Nina Raine’s widely produced “Tribes,” he has significant film credits and was prominently featured in the first season of the “Fargo” TV series. But even he has had difficulty finding parts.
“How many roles are there out there that incorporate ASL?” he wrote in an email message. “The opportunities are rare.” The idea that hearing actors might be cast in deaf roles affronts him. “If someone were to make a movie about my life and cast a hearing actor to play me …” He couldn’t complete the sentence.
When the roles are available, producers, directors and casting directors may have to search harder for disabled actors. Mandy Greenfield, the artistic director at Williamstown, agreed that it took extra work to assemble a pool of possible stars for “Cost of Living.”
Ms. Majok’s script stipulates that John and Ani be played by disabled performers; Mr. Mozgala, who helped Ms. Majok develop the play (the description of cerebral palsy as an internal fistfight is his configuration), was a sure thing. But Williamstown had to do a rigorous search to find Ani.
“Our intense process yielded absolutely magical results,” Ms. Greenfield said. (Manhattan Theater Club has yet to confirm casting for the spring production, but producers said they would honor Ms. Majok’s stipulation.)
Unlike her character, Ms. Sullivan is not paralyzed but rather runs record-setting sprints on prosthetic limbs. Conveying paralysis requires acting; maneuvering without prosthetics contributed to her understanding of the character.
“It helps me get to a place of vulnerability, because that’s not how I live my life,” she said. “I tend to wear my prosthetics wherever I go, and they make me feel a certain confidence. Taking those off, in some ways, is like being naked.”
It remains to be seen whether the recent casting of disabled actors marks a temporary uptick or a more lasting trend. Though D. J. Kurs, the artistic director of Deaf West, believes that “Spring Awakening” showed audiences the evocative language and gestures of deaf actors, “My cynical side, however, reminds me that the collective memory is short,” he wrote by email.
Mr. Mozgala hopes that artists themselves will create opportunities. His company, the Apothetae, has commissioned playwrights with this aim. “My community, and the history of disabled people, is fascinating,” he said. “Me just walking across the street — there’s something dramatic going on.”

SAN FRANCISCO — In its three years of existence, Google Capital has been known for its investments in privately held start-ups like SurveyMonkey and Credit Karma.
Now it is expanding into investing in publicly traded companies — starting with Care.com, a specialist in helping connect families and caregivers of all stripes.
Google Capital said on Wednesday that it had invested $46.35 million in the $278 million company, making it the single biggest shareholder.
The transaction represents a new step for Google Capital, one of the investment arms of the technology conglomerate Alphabet. Unlike Alphabet’s GV, which is better known for investing in early-stage companies, Google Capital tends to invest in older “growth stage” businesses that are looking to expand.
But Google Capital has not previously invested in publicly traded companies. Now it is following in the footsteps of investment firms like Silver Lake that have bought preferred shares in publicly traded companies.
Care.com was founded in 2007 and went public in early 2014. The company offers customers a range of services that include babysitting, senior care, housekeeping and pet sitting, as well as options to manage taxes for nannies through its HomePay service.
To Care.com’s founder and chief executive, Sheila Lirio Marcelo, bringing in Google Capital provides money to help the business expand — and gain access to what she said were the resources on tap at Google and its parent, Alphabet.
“It’s a huge opportunity for Care.com,” she said in a telephone interview. “Through Google Capital, we can get access to Google and Alphabet’s experts.”
Care.com first became known to Google when the technology company signed up as a customer five years ago. That eventually prompted Laela Sturdy, a partner at Google Capital who was looking to use Care.com’s services, to inquire into investing in the company.
“Care.com exemplifies the kind of company that we want to invest in,” Ms. Sturdy said in an interview. “We’ve been focused on growth-stage companies, and really our only criteria is their having Google-sized aspirations.”
Under the terms of the deal, Google Capital will buy convertible preferred stock in Care.com at a conversion price of $10.50 a share, or 24 percent above Wednesday’s closing price for its common stock. The preferred shares pay an annual interest rate of 5.5 percent.
Also, Ms. Sturdy will receive a seat on the board.
Connected to Wednesday’s deal, Care.com said that it would buy back 3.7 million shares owned by an early backer, Matrix Partners. Ms. Marcelo said the move limited the dilution of the Google Capital transaction to roughly 2 percent.
Morgan Stanley and the law firm Latham & Watkins advised Care.com.

URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/fashion/couture-confessions-pamela-golbin.html

The force that gives one couture house, or one fashion designer, the power to shape the tastes of women has always verged on the magical — sometimes literally.
When the French couturier Christian Dior was a teenager in Normandy, a fortuneteller told him, “You will be poor, but you will achieve success through women.”
He was, apparently, “mystified” by the prediction, or so it is revealed in “Couture Confessions,” a collection of posthumous conversations between the author, Pamela Golbin, the chief curator of fashion and textiles at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and 11 fashion eminences of the 20th century, including Paul Poiret, Jeanne Lanvin, Madeleine Vionnet, Dior, Coco Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen.
But Ms. Golbin did not need to consult a fortuneteller (or a Ouija board) to channel her subjects. The couturiers may no longer be living, but each left behind hundreds of opinionated, character-filled interviews (and, in some cases, autobiographies), making it possible for her to invent tailor-made questions about their challenges and creative processes and then provide answers in their recorded words.
While this may sound a mite peculiar, it works convincingly, rather like an extended séance in which the dressmakers visit Ms. Golbin, one after another, and share their secrets. The book is enhanced with black-and-white drawings by the illustrator Yann Legendre. And as you read it, you feel like a boulevardier in present-day Paris, sitting at a cafe and leafing through a magazine chock-full of revelations.
The most charming of Ms. Goldin’s subjects is probably Poiret, the “king of fashion” in the Belle Époque, who is quoted speaking with entertaining false humility about his renown. “Some have been good enough to say that I exercised a powerful influence over my age, and inspired an entire generation,” he said. While it would be “presumptuous” to agree, “If memory serves, when I started out all color was absent from fashion,” he added.
A more modest contemporary of Poiret’s, Jeanne Lanvin, acknowledged her expertise at the robe de style, the favorite of brides and prom queens everywhere: a “clinging bodice rising above a billowing skirt of rich or dainty fabric.” But, she said, “I very much prefer that my work shall speak for me.”
The British designer Alexander McQueen characterized his double-duty life, running his own house in London and Givenchy in Paris, as a kind of madness, saying: “I’m not tortured, I’m schizophrenic. I express the collision of my contradictions: romanticism encased in sadomasochism, for example.”
“All my work is biographical in some sense,” the collection quotes McQueen, who committed suicide in February 2010, as saying. “It has to be; otherwise there is no soul to it.”
Coco Chanel, frank and combative as always, attacked the miniskirt as “an exhibition of meat,” but upheld the primacy of the “spirit of Paris” as fashion’s supreme instigator.
“The genius of the French, in matters of fashion, has always been to be its wellspring,” she said. “Draw as much water as you want, but you can’t walk off with the fountain.” This may be why she didn’t mind when people copied her designs. “Every imitation has its basis in love for the original,” she said.
Pierre Balmain liked to say that “a couturier should let his work speak for itself,” but like Lanvin, he could not resist the temptation to verbally embellish his fashions. And neither could the rest of them — with the exception of the notoriously closemouthed Cristóbal Balenciaga, whose chapter Ms. Golbin fills with admiring commentary by Cecil Beaton, John Fairchild, Diana Vreeland, Coco Chanel and other tastemakers.
She hit upon the idea for the book in 2009, after curating a retrospective in Paris on Madeleine Vionnet, inventor of the bias cut, which gave a “supple, easy and promising” fluidity to fabric, freeing women from the armature of pre-World War I designs. For the exhibition catalog, Ms. Golbin explained to Hamish Bowles, European editor at large for American Vogue, that she devised a “conversation” with Vionnet — the lively, chatty dressmaker (who died in 1976) — folding in the couturière’s previously published comments. Readers felt such a connection, they sent her letters addressed to Vionnet, assuming she was still alive.
“Hearing them speak creates a dialogue, a conversation,” Ms. Golbin said. “I wanted to give the reader access into the private studio of each of these designers, to learn more about them and what makes them tick.”
Yves Saint Laurent once said: “Couture is a multitude of whispered secrets. Few have the privilege of transmitting them.” In “Couture Confessions,” Ms. Golbin removes the barrier, making visible the secrets that lurk in the dresses we once wore.

URL: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/business/dealbook/nearly-all-us-banks-pass-feds-stress-test.html

All but one of the nation’s largest banks earned an unconditional passing grade from federal regulators on their annual stress tests, which measure their preparedness to weather a financial crisis.
The one American-based institution that did not pass unconditionally was Morgan Stanley, a Wall Street bank that has been struggling to regain its footing after the financial crisis of 2008. Regulators raised concerns over the company’s internal controls and processes.
The Federal Reserve gave failing grades to the American subsidiaries of two European banks, Deutsche Bank and Santander, which both failed in previous years.
The banking stress tests — which measure whether banks have enough capital and liquidity, management controls and other necessary safeguards to survive various worst-case situations — have been required of banks with more than $50 billion in assets since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, which took effect in 2010.
The passing grades mean that all of the big banks — even Morgan Stanley — will be able to pay dividends and buy back stock from shareholders.
The results, announced by the Fed on Wednesday afternoon, are the second part of the annual stress tests, which compel each institution to run a simulation of how it would bear up under various catastrophic conditions, like an abrupt rise in interest rates or unemployment, or a big crash in equity markets. Last week, the Fed said that all the big banks would be able to make it through a recession and still maintain adequate financial buffers.
On Wednesday, a Fed official said that even with the concerns raised, the stress test results suggest that banks would be able to withstand an event like Britain’s exit from the European Union, which has rocked bank stocks over the last week.
Since the financial crisis, banks have been required to create large capital barriers to cushion against losses from a recession or market shock. While the financial system has not encountered any problems close to the mortgage losses of 2008, banks have been able to withstand more recent challenges like the steep drop in oil prices and the turmoil in Europe.
While tougher capital requirements may be helping to stabilize the banks, they are hampering profitability. The stock prices of many large banks have languished as investors question whether these companies can increase their profits substantially in such a stringent new regulatory environment.
The stress test results announced Wednesday are no doubt a welcome relief, in particular, to Bank of America and Citigroup, which have had difficulty passing the test unconditionally in past years. Both banks have spent tens of millions of dollars and assigned some of their top executives to the task of ensuring that they gain the Fed’s approval.
Shortly after the results were made public, Citigroup announced that it would more than triple its dividend, to 16 cents from 5 cents, and buy back as much as $8.6 billion of stock. Bank of America said it would increase its dividend to 7.5 cents from 5 cents and purchase $5 billion in shares.
Even Morgan Stanley came forward to say that it planned to raise its dividend to 20 cents from 15 cents and increase its share buyback program to $3.5 billion for the four quarters beginning July 1, from $2.5 billion in the previous period.
The three banks that were called out by the Fed on Wednesday all had big enough financial buffers, the regulators said. Rather, the criticism was with more qualitative aspects of the way the three banks operate internally.
At Morgan Stanley, the Fed said, the problems “include shortcomings in the firm’s scenario design practices, which do not adequately reflect risks and vulnerabilities specific to the firm, weaknesses in some aspects of the firm’s modeling practices, and weaknesses in governance and controls around both scenario design and modeling practices.”
Morgan Stanley will be able to return money to shareholders, as planned, but it will need to improve its internal processes by the end of the year. If the bank does not make those improvements, the Fed could halt the bank’s payouts.
The results are an unhappy hiccup for Morgan Stanley, which has been struggling to raise its profits to the level of its competitors’ and is in the middle of a significant cost-cutting campaign.
In a statement, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, James P. Gorman, said, “We are committed to addressing the Fed’s concerns about our capital planning process and fully expect to meet their requirements within the established time frame.”
For Deutsche Bank and Santander, the failing grades raise bigger concerns about their ability to satisfy American regulators. The Deutsche Bank unit in the United States has failed twice in a row, and Santander three times.
In this and previous years, the Fed has applied its tests only to parts of Santander and Deutsche Bank. These two banks, as well as other foreign banks, like Barclays, UBS and Credit Suisse, have large operations in the United States that have not undergone stress tests. But that will soon change. The large foreign banks now have to organize their American operations into a single “intermediate holding company.”
Next year, the Fed will do a trial test of these entities and keep the results private. But in 2018, these large holding companies will be subjected to full-fledged tests, and the results will be made public. Failing those stress tests would be much more of a blow to Deutsche Bank and Santander than the hit they took on Wednesday.
A Fed official said on Wednesday that all the big banks had been making progress but that Deutsche Bank and Santander still needed to make significant improvements.
In a statement, Scott Powell, the chief executive of Santander Holdings USA, said, “We are financially sound. These results do not affect our ability to serve our customers.”
Deutsche Bank also emphasized that even though its American unit had failed the test, it still had adequate capital.
“We appreciate the Federal Reserve’s recognition of our progress, and we will implement the lessons learned this year in order to strengthen our capital planning process,” Bill Woodley, deputy chief executive of Deutsche Bank Americas said in a statement.
